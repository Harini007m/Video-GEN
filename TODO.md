# TODO for Fixing Flask App Issues

Based on the log analysis, here are the steps to fix the issues:

1. **Add /meta.json route**: Create a new route in app.py to return basic metadata JSON to resolve the 404 error.
2. **Fix /upload route**: Improve file handling in the upload route to ensure files are processed correctly, removing problematic checks like file.read().
3. **Test the changes**: Restart the Flask server and verify that /meta.json returns 200 and /upload handles files properly.

Progress:
- [x] Add /meta.json route
- [x] Fix /upload route
- [ ] Test the application
