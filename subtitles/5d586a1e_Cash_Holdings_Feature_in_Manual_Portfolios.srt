Hey there, I wanted to show you a new feature which is cash holdings in manual portfolios.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,280
You can now add a theoretical cash value in your manual portfolio which is helpful to

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,340
more closely illustrate the balance of your manual portfolio.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,560
This cash balance will be displayed and added to your all holdings and all portfolio balances

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
too.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
So to add a cash balance, what we want to do is click on edit portfolio and then we'll

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,760
click at the bottom edit lots.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,680
And at the bottom of this edit lots worksheet, there is a box to add cash balance in portfolio.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm going to go ahead and add a value and hit save.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
And once I hit save, you can see that the cash value is at the bottom of my holdings

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,320
tab and it even calculates the weight of the cash in my portfolio too.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,880
So the weight is updated as well as the overall balance of my portfolio to reflect the cash

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,760
that I entered.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,600
And as I said, this balance will also be added to your all portfolios and all holdings pages.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,680
So if we go to all holdings, we'll see all of our portfolios and the holdings on one

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
page.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,120
If we scroll down to the bottom, we'll see cash and if we expand the row, we'll see

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,360
that there's cash in my income portfolio and my second portfolio and the corresponding

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,280
weights to each one of those cash balances with my overall weights of all my holdings.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,280
I can also update the cash in my portfolio when I'm adding new tickers to my portfolio.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:33,440
So if I also click on the add symbol button and I find a ticker and I hit next, I'll be

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,400
able to add in a number of shares, a date of purchase and a cost for the new ticker in

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,120
my portfolio, which I'll do.

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,480
And I can edit the cash balance on this modal as well and hit save and my cash balance will

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,400
be updated there as well.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,880
So this is a new feature, which is cash holdings in manual portfolios that lets you add a theoretical

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,920
cash value to more closely illustrate the balance of your manual portfolios.

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,520
Thanks so much.
