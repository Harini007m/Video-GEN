00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey everyone, it's Daniel Snyder from Seeking Alpha.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,760
Welcome to probably the most important webinar we have ever done in the past few years that

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
we've been doing this.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,480
Today, I am joined by the All Stars, Steven Kress here from Seeking Alpha VP of Quantity

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,400
of Strategies as well as Francesca Friday, who also works with Steve on the Quant team.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
And we are going to dive through everything macro, what's going on with the markets, as

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,280
well as what is the investment approach going forward that can help you probably sleep a

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
little bit more soundly at night.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,080
Before we dive in, let me go ahead and get our quick legal disclaimer out of the way.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,600
We are not advising you personally concerning the nature, potential value or suitability

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,480
of any particular security.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,360
or any product or service is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,120
objectives and personal and financial situation.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,840
This presentation is for information purposes only content is presented as of the date

It represents my opinions, Francesca's opinions and Steven's opinions, which may not reflect

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,000

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,960
Past performance is no guarantee of future results and Seeking Alpha is not a licensed

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,960
Now with that out of the way, Steve, there's a lot of uncertainty out there.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,720
You've been calling this for a while, but before we dive in for the people that may

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,280
be joining us for the first time, why don't you give them a quick background about yourself?

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
Daniel, thank you so much for organizing this today.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
Highly important and led all the moves that are happening, a lot of fear and anxiety out

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,160
there and we're hoping we could address that today.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,000
I have been in the markets for quite a long time, almost 35 years in the financial markets,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,040
so I do have a fair amount of experience through highs and lows.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,120
My background has really been mostly in brokerage firms and asset management.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,440
I've been a portfolio manager, headed up a prop trading desk at Morgan Stanley and Quant

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Strategies for 13 years.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
That was the bulk of my career.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I also had a hedge fund that I founded in Quant Strategies and I started a FinTech company

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,640
that was acquired by Seeking Alpha about six years ago, which for lack of a better description

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,200
was one of the first versions of AI for a robo-advisor and picking stocks.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,280
That's a little bit about my career.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,960
For those who are familiar with me, I've been writing for Seeking Alpha for a long time

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,360
and I run the Quant models and Alpha picks for Seeking Alpha.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm joined by our Quant writer, Francesca Friday, who joined us from the Financial Times.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Francesca, tell us a little bit about yourself as well.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,480
Hey, thanks for having me, Daniel and Steve.

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,880
I joined the Seeking Alpha team late last year from a place called Merger Market, where

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,480
I was a senior private equity reporter.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,160
That's where a lot of my background is covering the private markets.

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,360
I also wrote the FT's award-winning newsletter, Due Diligence, and that covers topics from

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,280
M&A to private equity to hedge funds.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,320
I'm really excited to be a part of the team and diving a little bit more into the public

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,200
markets with Quant.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Thank you so much.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,440
I'd say with Daniel Snyder, who always has his finger on the pulse of the markets, this

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
is a great trio to be having this discussion today.

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,640
I've had a mantra for quite a while, many markets, many presentations like this.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,360
Keep calm and carry on.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,800
For those who know myself and Daniel, we've had quite a few webinars like this, when the

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,000
markets have been rolling off quite considerably, and this consistently has been our mantra

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,160
and it is not going to change today.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,120
We actually started the mantra most recently in January with a couple articles that I had

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,040
written and guidance that I had given to the market.

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,720
First off though, I want to really start with what our Quant vision is.

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:47,400
That is to eliminate emotional investing and uncovered top stocks using data driven tactics,

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,080
which is especially important today because there's a lot of emotion out there and there's

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,520
a lot of fear.

63
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,960
What we really want people to do is just stay true to a disciplined investment process.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't really pay attention to the talking heads.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
There's a lot going on on Bloomberg, on CNBC, on CNN.

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Everybody's talking about the fall from the financial markets, the tariffs.

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,440
A lot of uncertainty, a lot of unknown impacts.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,320
Really the best thing that you can do is just stay focused and trying to find good investments

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,840
based on good financials and good fundamentals.

70
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,320
That's going to be a good portion of our presentation today.

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
Our Quant vision, turbulent times and market volatility, turn your weakness into opportunity.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,920
This is a message that I've had time again during periods like this.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,840
I think individuals who have heeded that have done quite well by taking market uncertainty

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
and volatility and using it to their favor.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,600
It can be your best friend.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,320
What we're going to cover today is why Quant.

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,560
We're going to do a recap on the markets.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,520
We'll obviously be covering what's going on with our approach to investing in markets.

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,560
First, a little bit about Quant and what we do.

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,120
We basically at seeking out our Quant strategy is a GARP-oriented strategy that is growth

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
at a reasonable price.

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,760
We're looking for stocks in essence that have strong fundamentals based on growth, value,

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,840
profitability, positive analyst EPS revisions and momentum.

84
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,720
Those are our core factors that we look at.

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,240
Because of the ability of our incredible computer models and the powerful computer processing

86
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,560
that we possess, we can take those factors and basically score every investable stock

87
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
every single day.

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Literally, we provide a directional recommendation on every single stock.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,040
When we do it, we're looking at the metrics for our companies and we're going through

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,200
cash flow, income statements, balance sheets, and hundreds of financial metrics.

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,560
We compare the metrics for companies to other companies in the sector.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,520
This gives us the ability to filter out the weak companies from the strong companies.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,880
Part of what we're doing today in our approach, in this balance approach to investing during

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,240
this turbulent period, is to look for stocks that possess really good fundamentals.

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,360
Of course, heating what's going on in the markets and trying to help eliminate some

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,360
of the losses that could occur is to encourage people to invest in stocks that have good

97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,120
fundamentals with dividends as well.

98
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,560
The barbell approach is continue to look for companies that have excellent fundamentals

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,320
regardless of the dividend, identify those companies, but also identify companies that

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,160
do pay dividends that have good fundamentals and use that as your balanced barbell approach.

101
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,400
We have a pretty good track record at Seeking Alpha with our quant performance.

102
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,160
If you could bear with me, I just really want to go through that.

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,400
We have a back test that goes back to 2010, which shows what our investments would have

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,840
been like had you invested in all the quant strong buys.

105
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,560
What's interesting about this chart is the back test actually runs from 2010 to 2019.

106
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,040
After 2019, we have the system up and running and there are simulated trades.

107
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,800
Because we know what factors that we look at, we could identify those stocks historically

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,640
that possess those factors.

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,000
What we do is we back test trying to identify the factors that have the greatest amount of

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
predictability.

111
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,280
Over time, we have come up with weights.

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,560
When we're looking at the factors such as value, growth, profitability, momentum, and

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,920
the many underlying metrics for those overall factors, it's not equally weighted.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,240
Some factors have greater weights than others.

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Using that system, we've been able to achieve some outstanding results over a long period

116
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
of time.

117
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,760
If you look back to the initial back test, you would see your return would be 2,900%

118
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,440
compared to the S&P that has a return of 458% for the same period.

119
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,720
If you look at the recent history where we've been up and running starting in 2020 where

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,320
the trades have been simulated, the performance is still just as good.

121
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,640
You can see the quant strong buys were up 347% versus the S&P on the far right up 135%.

122
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,760
The purpose of showing this is we actually don't have an investable product.

123
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,120
There's not an ETF or a mutual fund of our strong buys.

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,760
The point of showing this is to identify how the concept works well, which is that GARP

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,400
approach and using the certain weights that we have on factors, it has presented us with

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
some fantastic opportunities that we continue to repeat over time.

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,560
As a premium member or an AlphaPix member, you have the ability to obtain these stocks

128
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,280
that are recommended and have these directional recommendations based on the underlying factors.

129
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,800
That's how we've achieved such good performance over a long time.

130
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Steve.

131
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,680
I want to jump in real quick.

132
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,480
I want you to have your victory lap.

133
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
Get back to what we're talking about today.

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Obviously, we can talk about the quant system all day, but you've been calling for this

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,440
market uncertainty for months now.

136
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,840
It feels like you've been writing the articles.

137
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,480
You've been doing webinars with myself.

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,840
We just published the top 10 stocks for April video earlier this week where even you were

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,000
talking about the barbell approach.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,080
If you go to the next slide, we can showcase the work that you've been putting out there.

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,760
I just want to encourage everybody, if you're not already, follow Stephen Cress on Seeking

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Alpha.

143
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You've been getting these articles.

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,840
You know that this environment was set up to be uncertain and volatile like it is today.

145
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,200
Grant Cheska was kind enough to pull this slide together to showcase that day.

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,640
Trying to be as humble as possible and having assessed the markets for a long time, from

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,680
my perspective, I was able to tell back in early January that there were problems with

148
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
the market.

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,080
One of the things that I say about our quant model is it's often like a Richter scale.

150
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
We notice that there are problems with the stocks that we have strong buys.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Typically we're identifying the best companies and the best industries and the best sectors.

152
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
They have the strongest growth rates.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,960
They have the best valuation frameworks that have great profitability.

154
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,760
What tends to happen during these periods before the market turns, our quant strong

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,600
buys often become very volatile and start selling off.

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,960
What we're able to see is that there's an early rotation where there's a flight of

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
capital.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,920
That flight of capital could be to defensive sectors like consumer staples or utilities

159
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,120
or cash or gold.

160
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,480
What's interesting is when this initially happens and much like a Richter scale will

161
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,480
go off, it could take a little time before that earthquake happens.

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,320
The overall market actually continued to go up.

163
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
It was going up as investors were rotating into these different sectors.

164
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,680
You could see I wrote this article back on January 10th, the best defensive stocks to

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
hedge against the market uncertainty.

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,400
Then on January 27th, feeling bearish.

167
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,360
Then of course on February 25th, brace for turbulence.

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,080
That was just after the market had peaked, I believe the S&P 500 at that point.

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
We saw those signs.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,600
When I looked at the market, it was obvious to see what some of the key signs were that

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,720
was causing that disturbance.

172
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,880
There was increasing talk of tariffs.

173
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,560
There was also a degradation that was starting to occur in earnings, especially with the

174
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,640
magnificence in seven stocks.

175
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,600
I pointed out in many of these articles with the max seven stocks that their year-over-year

176
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,840
growth had actually been higher than their four growth rates.

177
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
That was across the board for all seven stocks.

178
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,640
Obviously, we have the largest seven market cap stocks.

179
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,000
Their growth rates are starting to slow compared to their year-over-year growth rates.

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,440
Then you had the position coming out of the administration with the drumbeat that was

181
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
getting louder and louder on tariffs.

182
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,840
It was obvious to see why there was volatility with many of our quant strong buys early on.

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,960
It doesn't matter how good the company's earnings results are or their top line results

184
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,120
When markets get defensive, it's just a giant sucking sound.

185
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,000
It rotates into defensive sectors, as I mentioned, healthcare, utilities, REITs, consumer staples,

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
cash, gold, and people sell stocks where they made money.

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,000
It doesn't matter if the fundamentals are good or not.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
They're trying to raise capital.

189
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
They're trying to raise cash and they're trying to allocate into sectors that will

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,280
offer them some protection, regardless of how good the companies are.

191
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,600
That's exactly what we started to experience in early January and why I was writing about

192
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
it.

193
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,200
I also want to highlight, I put this slide up in February 23rd.

194
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,960
Will there be a 10% correction?

195
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,520
I highlighted a long-term outlook then predicting the exact likelihood of a 10% stock market

196
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,800
correction in 2025 is challenging due to many unpredictable factors.

197
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
However, history does provide some context.

198
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:14,240
One of the key bullet points that we had here was between 2002 and 2021, the S&P 500

199
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,120
experienced declines of 10% or more in 10 out of 20 years, indicating that such corrections

200
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,040
occur approximately every two years.

201
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:31,240
The history had shown we were at a point where the bull market had run and it was entering

202
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,760
its third year.

203
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,040
Previously, when you went more than two years with markets that had returns in excess of

204
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,760
20%, we found that between 2.25 years and 3.25 years, the market on average would return

205
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,440
at that point after 4.8%.

206
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,520
Hence that correction that came.

207
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,040
That might sound a little bit complex, but basically the way that the math works is that

208
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,840
in three couple of years the market has a crash and that crash likely will be a minimum

209
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,920
of 10% and in some cases 20%.

210
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
We were really hitting on the cusp of it.

211
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,800
The timing was perfect for this to actually occur.

212
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,320
I did write a couple articles today that I wanted to highlight, which I think are very

213
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
timely.

214
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
One of the articles is tariff-resistant investments, three stocks for trade turbulence.

215
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,800
The article that I wrote was Trump bump, hits us lump, eight stocks for a downturn.

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,800
If you have a chance on seeking alpha, you could look up my name and find these articles

217
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,880
and please do follow me so you can see some of the articles that I write in the future

218
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
as well.

219
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,600
This brings us to our current period of 2025 and what the market normalization is going

220
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,640
to be just after this incredible rotation that we've been seeing.

221
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,800
Just keeping in mind in 2023 and 2024, the markets then were dominated by the MAC7 and

222
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,560
you may recall in the past few years that we've been doing this.

223
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,080
This is still a difficult environment because in 2023, we had rising rates, we had increasing

224
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,360
inflation.

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,920
Really investors had a bit of a rotation to what then was the safe haven or the stocks

226
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
that had cash that were really profitable that were the MAC7 stocks.

227
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Based on the fears of rising rates and inflation, but in combination with the AI revolution,

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,920
you had the MAC7 do incredibly well during 2023 and 2024 as well.

229
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,880
However, as we're coming into 2025, there's a lot of volatility.

230
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,040
We have tariffs, we have economic uncertainty, we've had a lot of executive orders coming

231
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,680
out of the White House, we've had changes in the regulatory environment.

232
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,080
There's been incredible gyrations and there's also been the beginning of some massive layoffs

233
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,160
in the federal government as well.

234
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,000
Now, at a corporate level, many of the executives and CFOs are facing a lot of uncertainty with

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the tariffs.

236
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,520
There's uncertainty with what they're going to be doing with their CAPEX budgets going

237
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,020
forward.

238
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,920
Up until a couple of days ago, the MAC7 stocks were down on average about 6.7%.

239
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,840
That has quickly changed.

240
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
That's actually a little bit old.

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,720
I think right now, the MAC7 stocks are down on average about 20% at this point.

242
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,640
You can see just a couple of days ago, the S&P was down 5.54%.

243
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,600
At this point today, the S&P is down over 11%.

244
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,200
Just in the few days that we've been in the S&

245
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,040
The market has come down tremendously.

246
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,360
What is the normalization that we're going to most likely see for 2025?

247
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,040
As I mentioned, the S&P has pulled back roughly 10% or 11% from its 52-week high, which was

248
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,600
at this point about 45 days ago.

249
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,240
The Nasdaq, I believe, is down almost 20% from its high.

250
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,640
Ignoring the slide here, and that was about 110 days ago.

251
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,080
Just in the last five days, we've had these huge moves in the market.

252
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,160
The concerns are around tariffs, inflation, corporate earnings deterioration, and the

253
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,640
looming and increasing fears that a recession may occur.

254
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,320
All these have contributed to the pullback that we see.

255
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,720
On the back of these fears, investors, obviously, they've been taking profits.

256
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,760
They've been selling their stocks that are winning.

257
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,800
When I say those stocks that have been winning, you could look at the MAC7 stocks.

258
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,960
You could look at a lot of the stocks that we've been recommending over the last year.

259
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,040
They have been hit particularly hard in the last couple of weeks, despite the incredible

260
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,400
results that they've had in terms of their earnings announcements.

261
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,280
What has done well, we've seen a shift to consumer staples, as I mentioned, utilities,

262
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,320
REITs, healthcare, cash, and gold.

263
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,200
That's how the market plays out during a period of fear, which is exactly what we're experiencing

264
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,400
right now.

265
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,560
This next slide says blind faith has a short shelf life.

266
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,600
This just serves an example that really just in November and December, Wall Street was

267
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,960
rejoicing Trump won the election.

268
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,800
They did announce the aggressive tariff plans, but really at the time, people thought that

269
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,320
that would be a tool for negotiation.

270
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,720
That has clearly turned from a tool of negotiation into a reality.

271
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,160
At this point, we have fears of stagnation, which are starting to mount.

272
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,040
We have other countries that will be matching tariff increase.

273
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,200
We have basically a tariff where that's occurring.

274
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
We're probably starting to see a slowdown in economic growth.

275
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,680
We'll probably see rising unemployment.

276
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,000
We'll probably see inflation numbers coming in much harder than expected and added to

277
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
your all holdings and all portfolio balances balances.

278
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:19,600
This is a good chart on the right-hand side, which shows you how much consumer confidence

279
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
has slipped.

280
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,480
This is before yesterday.

281
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,400
You can see the incredible change in delta from consumer confidence in November of 24

282
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,080
to March 2025, where it dropped to 92.9 from 111.

283
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,720
This is prior to what happened yesterday.

284
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,800
We'll probably continue to see consumer confidence slip in the weeks and months ahead.

285
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,000
We'll probably be seeing it on the corporate level as well.

286
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
This is why this is occurring.

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I've already mentioned.

288
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,680
What I want to show here is the VIX.

289
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,800
We had a period back, I believe it was August last year.

290
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Daniel, is that correct?

291
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Yes.

292
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,080
Where you put up a similar slide and the VIX had surged over 60.

293
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Only time previously to that, in recent history, was during the great financial crisis.

294
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,720
We're seeing today the VIX is not up as much as it was during that one-geration or during

295
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
the financial crisis.

296
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,920
I think the market can take heart to that, that this is a bit of an orderly sell-off

297
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
that we're seeing.

298
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:33,400
Today, we're really seeing with the movement in interest rates today, investors are going

299
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
into bonds.

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,440
Bonds are going up a bit, yields are going down, people continue to go into cash, people

301
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,120
continue to go into consumer staples, even today, as we're speaking, based on the fears

302
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,320
of unemployment rising, economic uncertainty, and what's going to happen with inflation

303
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
with all these tariffs.

304
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,320
The good news is we can see that the VIX has not surged to some of those previous levels,

305
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,360
which tells you it's a bit of an orderly sell-off.

306
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,480
Daniel, I want you to tell us about this chart.

307
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Yes, Steve, thank you.

308
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,280
I think this is, like I said, this is probably the most important webinar we've ever done.

309
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,680
I want to take a second and just remind people what the VIX actually is, what it actually

310
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,760
does, because it always comes up in conversation.

311
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,240
People lose hindsight of the VIX is a calculation of the option prices 30 days in the future,

312
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
calculating the strikes and the implied vol that the market is seeking.

313
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,840
If people are hedged, you don't get these massive shoots that just pop up like crazy

314
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
in the VIX.

315
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
So keep that in mind.

316
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,960
Also, you have to remember the historical average of the VIX is around that 20 level.

317
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,400
So when you take that 20 level and start building out standard deviations of cash holdings in manual

318
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:51,320
portfolios, you can now add a theoretical cash value in a theoretical cash value in your portfolio portfolio in your portfolio, which is helpful to more closely illustrate the balance of your portfolio.

319
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,960
When that happened, we barely got over the 28 level before the market pulled back.

320
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,240
That was a moment in time where people were wondering if they need to take cash out of

321
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
their bank accounts.

322
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,840
They were anticipating a failure and yet the VIX never got above 30 really.

323
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,280
Then if you go to the next slide, as you were talking about on August 5th, we saw a five

324
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,880
standard deviation event on a Monday morning because people didn't know what was going

325
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,040
on in the currency market.

326
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,840
No nuke got shot in the air.

327
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
The markets were still open that day.

328
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,880
They didn't close.

329
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Like for the VIX to pop, right?

330
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
There is still a possibility.

331
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm not going to say there's not a possibility here, but for the VIX to pop, there has to

332
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,480
be something unseen that hasn't been hedged by everyone on Wall Street and customers

333
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,280
out around the world.

334
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,640
People knew about the tariffs to what Steve was saying.

335
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
They knew the tariff announcement was coming.

336
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,720
This is why, as Steve mentioned, it feels like a controlled sell off in the market, which

337
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,800
is why we only got to about that negative 5% value today.

338
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,880
I just wanted to highlight that.

339
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,400
I think this applies.

340
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,600
I did throw a little plug there for our quant system.

341
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,920
During the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, our quant rating system was one of the very,

342
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,200
very few systems on Wall Street that had a sell on Silicon Valley Bank.

343
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,920
I don't think there was one other firm out of the big tier banks or the second tier

344
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
brokerage firms.

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,040
One was really calling for a sell.

346
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,520
Our quant system had a sell on a number of the banks that actually had to merge or were

347
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,200
taken over during that period.

348
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,080
Hats off to the quant system during that period.

349
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm going to take us to what we're seeing in terms of a 30-day recap, bringing us right

350
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,880
into this current period.

351
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,920
As you can see, it continues with this rotation.

352
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Looking on the far right over the last four weeks, the one-month period, we're seeing a

353
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,480
move into energy.

354
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
I think that has sold off today, so that's probably beginning to disappear.

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
I took this from early this morning.

356
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,960
Energy stocks have moved down as well.

357
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,160
You'd see the sectors that perform well were utility and consumer staples.

358
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,280
To a certain extent, basic materials.

359
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,640
Basic materials are interesting because commodities actually fluctuate quite a bit every year.

360
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,160
The fact that we have these tariffs that are coming in at all different levels anywhere

361
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:21,000
from 10% to maybe 30%, people have to bake in a lot of volatility with basic materials

362
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,920
and commodity prices.

363
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,520
That's why you're not going to see that sell off.

364
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,400
Of course, people are moving into gold and silver as well.

365
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
That will impact basic materials.

366
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,680
Of course, if you look at the bottom on the right-hand side, just in the four-week period,

367
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,560
the sectors that have sold off sharply were the ones that are the best performing sectors

368
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,400
for the last two years running.

369
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,360
Consumer discretionary communication services, those sectors that were the best performing

370
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,040
ones have sold off.

371
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
This is a recap.

372
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,760
We have a bit of an orderly sell off today because this has occurred over the last four

373
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,640
weeks as rotation.

374
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,840
The tariffs were not really a huge surprise, hence the VIX not getting to those previous

375
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
levels.

376
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,280
Part of the warning that I mentioned that we saw early on in Jang Ray was the discussion

377
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,760
of tariffs growing and that sound getting louder and louder.

378
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,840
I put together this graph because the market and economists and the economy do not like

379
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
tariffs.

380
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,640
You can see on this graph over here and the performance of the S&P 500, the year that

381
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,880
tariffs were launched.

382
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,160
The big year was when Herbert Hoover was president.

383
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,880
In 1930, he launched the Smoot-Holly Tariffs.

384
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,080
The tariffs that are most similar to the ones that we are seeing today, which were global

385
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
tariffs.

386
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,520
In 1930, the market fell 28.5%.

387
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,840
That was on the back of the market coming off sharply in 1929.

388
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,560
Of course, that was really driven by an incredible amount of margin that was made available to

389
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,160
the market margin calls and then central banks tightening into that period when the market

390
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,000
was collapsing.

391
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,000
In 1929, and then having the Smoot-Holly Tariffs in 1930, it was a really harsh period for

392
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,920
the market over a two-and-a-half-year period there.

393
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,240
The tariffs had such a negative impact on the markets that there wasn't another president

394
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,480
until Richard Nixon that launched tariffs.

395
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,000
That was during the Nixon shock.

396
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Those were pretty light.

397
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,400
In the year he launched it, the market was pretty much unchanged.

398
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,560
However, I will say a recession did follow that.

399
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,920
The recession started in 1969, resurfaced through 1973, abated, and then continued again

400
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,120
into 1975.

401
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,480
It was a really bad economic period in 1969 through 1975.

402
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,760
Again, tariffs not having a good impact on the market, but George Bush, to a limited

403
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,280
extent, had steel tariffs that he announced in 2002.

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,480
The market reacted very negatively to that.

405
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
It was down 23%.

406
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,680
Of course, there were other issues during each of these periods.

407
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,360
You have the oil shock in 1970.

408
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,160
Of course, you had the start of the Depression in 1929.

409
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:20,320
Then when George Bush was president, obviously, we had the Iraq war occur and the horrible

410
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,280
New York crisis with a World Trade Center that occurred too.

411
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,760
That was a pretty horrific period.

412
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,320
It's not all tariff-related.

413
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,840
In 2018, Donald Trump had China and steel tariffs, so very limited compared to the amount

414
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
of tariffs announced yesterday, but the market fell about 6.2%.

415
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,160
Then, of course, you had the pandemic.

416
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm not sure what it is about tariffs, but they seem to come along with periods in time

417
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,360
where there are other events that are not very timely.

418
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,720
On average, during these tariffs, during the first year that they were launched, the S&P

419
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,200
fell about 14.5%.

420
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,840
You're already seeing the NASDAQ probably about off 20%, and the S&P 500 close to that now.

421
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
Here's a little bit of history as well.

422
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,560
We took 14 major crises that have occurred since 1980.

423
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
We have measured the decline.

424
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,920
What I'm looking at here is the question that I'm getting is how long could this potentially last?

425
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,320
Since 1980, the markets have entered a correction every 3.2 years.

426
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,560
173 days is the median pullback period.

427
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,760
If we were to base it now, if I was getting that question now, how much longer would this last,

428
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,440
I would say at a data-driven approach, we could say if we were to hit that median period of 173 days,

429
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
we're already 45 days into the pullback.

430
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,880
That means that we would hit that 173-day median August 9th of 2025.

431
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
During this summer, we'll get to that point where the median has occurred.

432
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,760
It's likely the pullback may have even occurred before that point.

433
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,560
You could see throughout these 14 periods, on average, the market fell about 25%.

434
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,240
The average amount of days was 253%.

435
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,080
The median return was negative 20%, with a median number of days being 173.

436
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,800
Worst case scenario, I put at the bottom, and they didn't include it because it's an outlier,

437
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,960
but of course, that was a stock market crash and the smooth holy towers from 1929 to 1932,

438
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,800
where the market was off 86%.

439
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,960
As an outlier, I did not include that in those numbers, but it's really not uncommon.

440
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,680
We have this every 3.2 years.

441
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,280
The market will pull back.

442
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
Sometimes it's 10%.

443
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,840
Sometimes it's 15%.

444
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
Sometimes it's 20%.

445
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,680
There are events that occur.

446
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
This is a structural event.

447
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
Tariffs are big.

448
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,000
The impact could be felt more than just today.

449
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,240
The market's going to continue to look to see what happens with inflation numbers.

450
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,840
What are the chances that the Fed will have to take interest rates back up?

451
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,440
So that's what the market is going to be looking at, as well as companies pulling back on cap expending.

452
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,680
So there's a lot that the market has to still digest.

453
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,920
In terms of what interest rate traders are betting on,

454
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,400
they're looking for May.

455
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,320
Most interest rate traders, about 72% of them think that interest rates won't move at all,

456
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,560
and that the Federal Reserve will hold steady.

457
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,320
About 27% of the interest rate traders are looking for a 25 basis point cut.

458
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,960
So clearly, the majority of traders are looking for no change by the Fed,

459
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
and that rates will stay the same.

460
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,080
If we take this out to July, that's a little bit different.

461
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,120
We have about 52% of interest rate traders looking for a 50 basis point cut by the time

462
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,360
we get to that July period, which is interesting because I said that medium date, it would be

463
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
August 9th.

464
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,960
So very interesting that does occur that we have a 50 basis point cut that could be a good

465
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,920
foundation for the markets to start to lift from that point.

466
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,280
Something I really want to highlight that's incredibly important is not,

467
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
you know, what we have these panic periods, not to sell.

468
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,520
And there's a lot of data that shows you why you don't want to sell during these periods.

469
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,760
And people obviously have sold off today.

470
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
The markets come off a lot.

471
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, as I said to Daniel before, the horse is already out of the barn.

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,800
There's no need to shut the gate at this point.

473
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,040
So what I want to highlight here is from JP Morgan Wealth Management.

474
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,960
They have highlighted that seven of the S&P 10s best days occurred within 15 days of the 10 worst.

475
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,800
So that means, again, like your best trading days occur right after the worst days.

476
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,080
And if you invested in the S&P 500 for over 20 years, you would have achieved annualized

477
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,280
returns of 10.5%.

478
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,360
However, if you missed out on just the 10 best days over that period, the return would be cut to 6.2%.

479
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,360
That's why it's really important to stay in the market during these periods

480
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,040
and not be scared out of it.

481
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,440
And something else that I really want to point out during really big panic periods.

482
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,600
So take a look at 2022, which was not that long ago.

483
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,040
On average, okay, most people have already forgotten this.

484
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:25,200
On average, the MAG 7 stocks declined by approximately 46% in 2022,

485
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,040
significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which fell about 19.4% that year.

486
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,440
So you probably recall that was the pandemic year.

487
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,920
However, just one year later in 2023, on average, the MAG 7 stocks surged by approximately 111%.

488
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,440
So 2022 down 46%, one year later, you're up 111%.

489
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,400
Let's take the worst case period.

490
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:58,160
If we go back to the Great Depression, 1929, from September 1929 to July 1932,

491
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,560
the beat that was a pretty long period, the S&P declined by 89%.

492
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,840
That is a whopping number.

493
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,800
Point is, don't panic.

494
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,600
Okay.

495
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:17,840
If you invested in the S&P 500 from July 1, 1932, and held it for just one year to July 1, 1933,

496
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,840
just one year later, the S&P 500 was up 159%.

497
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,360
So there you had a decline of 89% from 29 to 32.

498
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,560
And then from July of 32 to July of 33, just a year later, the market was up 159%.

499
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,280
So this is the entire reason why you do not want to panic during these periods.

500
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,040
Because if you do, you sell at the absolute worst time.

501
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,040
Hey, Steve, can I get a bit real quick?

502
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,560
I also just want to do a quick little plug because we're talking about the MAG 7 here.

503
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:53,040
The top 10 stocks for April, you actually selected a MAG 7 stock for that for the first time,

504
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,320
I feel like ever.

505
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,920
So that goes back to this market pullback is presenting opportunities.

506
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
But go back to the fundamentals, right?

507
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
Go back to the earnings, listen to management, see what's coming ahead.

508
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,040
But I just wanted to put that out there, that there was one MAG 7 stock that you did pick recently.

509
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah. And that's, you know, that had to do because the valuation framework has changed

510
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,320
during this market pullback.

511
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,680
So finally, you know, we, our garb system has growth at a reasonable price.

512
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,600
Most of the MAG 7 have multiples that are in the stratosphere.

513
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,320
So our system just doesn't invest in stocks like that.

514
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,160
And we have a great track record, as you saw.

515
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,000
We've beaten the Magnificent 7 stocks, you know, over time, we beat in the market over time.

516
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,840
We have an incredible track record using our garb strategy.

517
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
But we are going to avoid stocks like the MAG 7 that have multiples that are like 35, 40, 50,

518
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,360
70 times, 100 times.

519
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,440
They just won't be factored into our model.

520
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,720
But yeah, I believe, you know, Amazon had come down and that got wopped today too.

521
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,360
So the valuation is probably going to be more attractive on many of these MAG 7 stocks.

522
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,440
So we might actually be getting to see more of these become buys or strong buys in our model.

523
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,880
So looking again at, you know, not panicking, not selling, if we look at the last couple pullbacks

524
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,360
that we had.

525
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,240
So recent history, I'm just going back to 2010 here, we've had five times that the market has

526
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,360
pulled back 15%.

527
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,320
So what I wanted to show people, especially since a lot of the stocks that we've been

528
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
recommending recently have been hit really hard.

529
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
So I'm not going to deny that.

530
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,880
Okay.

531
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
As I said, it doesn't matter that most of these companies have been beating the results when

532
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,440
they announced, they've been hit really hard.

533
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
And that's because of the rotation that's occurred.

534
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,400
People are moving into cash and utilities and consumer staples and they're selling

535
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
stocks and they're selling stocks where they made money.

536
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,200
But the point being here, since 2010, if you had invested when the market pulled back 15%,

537
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,800
okay, if you took the just the top 10 quant strong buys, okay, any given day, we have 350

538
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,920
strong buys.

539
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,280
But if you had taken the market during that period and just taken the top 10 quant strong

540
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,400
buys and you held on to them for two years, on average, from those five different pullbacks,

541
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
your return would have been 117%.

542
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,080
But what I really want to point out here too is not only if you invested in the quant

543
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,200
strong buys during that period, when you've had a return of 117% and we actually purchased

544
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,120
the S&P 500, okay, and waited two years, your average return was almost 50%.

545
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,640
So that's like a huge return that you get out of the S&P if you take advantage when the market

546
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,080
has a 15% pullback.

547
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,880
It's better if you go into stocks that have really strong fundamentals, okay, but you're

548
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
still doing well, even if you went into the S&P.

549
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,200
And I think we're almost really at that period with the S&P now, we're probably down about

550
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,160
12% from its 52-week high, we're getting close to that 15% pullback.

551
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,800
So these are the type of times where you actually want to start to look at the stocks that have

552
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
good fundamentals.

553
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,080
And that's going to lead me to the barbell approach that we're going with.

554
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,720
So the tariffs are definitely a big structural problem.

555
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,400
This is not a one-off event.

556
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
It's not like a Silicon Valley bank.

557
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,840
And it's not even like a pandemic that you eventually know will be over at a certain period.

558
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,760
People are very, very uncertain what's going to happen with the tariffs,

559
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,920
what's going to happen with the tariff wars, what it means to companies in terms of their

560
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,080
earnings, employing people.

561
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,880
So there's a lot of uncertainty.

562
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,360
And what we advise during periods like this is to use this barbell approach

563
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,080
where we're looking at companies that pay dividends, but still companies that have very

564
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,680
strong fundamentals, but still pay dividends because that dividend and that yield will provide

565
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
you with some downside protection.

566
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,840
You're getting paid to wait.

567
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,520
But we also don't want you to ignore the stocks that have the best potential returns going forward.

568
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,360
So we're using this approach where we want you to continue to look for the companies

569
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,600
on a data-driven approach and just ignore how much the stocks have come down.

570
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,880
If they have strong quant grades for growth, for value, for profitability,

571
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,440
that's all you really want to focus on because some of these stocks are probably down 20, 30,

572
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,840
maybe 40 percent and has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the stocks.

573
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,320
Okay.

574
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,040
It has everything to do with the uncertainty environment and people selling stocks where

575
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,760
they've made money to go to safe havens.

576
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,400
So using this barbell approach will help you ensure that you have some limited protection

577
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,920
right now in the current market, but it will also serve to help you in finding opportunities

578
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
that can really pay off going forward.

579
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,680
So as such, the Trump bump hits a slump and we have eight stocks for you.

580
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,680
We have four reliable dividend stocks that can mitigate the risk in this volatile market

581
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,720
and four stocks that have strong growth that have pulled back significantly.

582
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
And we're hoping to capture some upside potential here.

583
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,240
So quickly we're going to go into these stocks.

584
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,080
This gives you a quick picture though that you could see what the quant strong buy ratings are,

585
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,080
the valuation grades, the growth grades, the profitability grades,

586
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,160
agency for the most part, these look pretty good.

587
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,480
So I want to take you to our dividend paying stocks.

588
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,800
And the first one up is going to be the Bank of New York.

589
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,800
And before Francesca tells you a little bit about it,

590
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,640
I'm actually going to take you to the CK Alpha platform and we're going to go to BK.

591
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,200
So we're now on the CK Alpha platform.

592
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,840
And this is actually one of the stocks that we're recommending today that's up,

593
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,680
which is a beverage company, but we're going to go to BK first, Bank of New York Mellon.

594
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
You can see it's a strong buy.

595
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,920
Over the last year, the stock is up 1%.

596
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,720
And you can see year to date, the stock is actually up 5.8%.

597
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,400
So it has significantly outperformed the S&P so far this year.

598
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,760
Today it's taking it on the nose down about 5%, which is in line with the S&P.

599
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,000
But if you look at the performance, especially the one year performance,

600
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,480
with the stock being up 41%, I'm going to take you right to the factor grades.

601
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,200
So these factor grades give you an instant characterization of where the stock stands

602
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,880
versus the rest of the sector.

603
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,600
So you can see Bank of New York is in the financial sector.

604
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,840
So what it's telling you is that the valuation is a little bit expensive compared to the sector.

605
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,240
But frankly, for a stock that's up 41%, if you look at the valuation score now versus six months

606
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
ago, it's roughly the same.

607
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,200
So you've had a stock that has gone up 41%, but it has the same valuation framework.

608
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,880
And what's really nice here is that the growth is actually a little bit stronger now

609
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,680
than it was compared to where it was six months ago.

610
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,720
But importantly against these are sector relative.

611
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,800
So you could see how it compares to the sector.

612
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
You're one click away from looking at growth.

613
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,360
So if you look at growth, you can see what the EBIT growth is.

614
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
You can see what the EPS growth is.

615
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,000
And you can see what the forward EPS growth is.

616
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,560
So it's very intuitive.

617
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,840
You can see that A minus is because the company has a 24% for growth rate versus the sector at 9.67%.

618
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,600
So it's trading at a 148% premium to the sector on its growth rate.

619
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,160
So there's a lot of great metrics in here.

620
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,960
If we go to profitability, you can see where it compares to the rest of the sector on that

621
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,280
income margin, on capex to sales or cash from operations or cash per share, which is huge.

622
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,160
They have $63 cash per share, hence the A plus grade versus the rest of the financial sector

623
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
at $6.87.

624
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,320
So I just wanted to show you if you're on the platform or if you're not a member,

625
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,800
how quickly you can find out how these companies compare to other companies.

626
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,720
And of course, you could just click on where it is in the industry or sector,

627
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,680
and it will show you our ranking on every single bank or any comparable within its industry.

628
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm going to take us back to the presentation and Francesca, I'm going to hand it over to you

629
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
so you can tell us a little bit more.

630
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,720
Thanks, Steve.

631
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,840
And just as a quick note, all eight of these stocks I'm about to dive into

632
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,560
are in the article that was published under Steve's profile this morning.

633
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,840
So he took you through the system, feel free to poke around and look at these in a bit further

634
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,840
detail through the article and seeking Alpha's quant platform.

635
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,160
So BNY is a $60.2 billion company.

636
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:40,560
Right now, it's ranked 29 in terms of all financials, but out of the custody bank industry

637
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,280
specifically, it's number two.

638
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,440
And just a couple of highlights from the QUAT metrics that really stood out to us when we're

639
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,960
making these assessments as to which stocks to recommend.

640
00:42:50,960 --> 00:43:01,040
There's a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, forward EPS gap growth of 24%, which is a 142.5 difference

641
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,320
from the sector median, underlining strong growth.

642
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,840
There's also really high dividend safety and consistency grades.

643
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,320
The QUAT dividend grades are a great measure of that category.

644
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,560
And it goes into a little further detail on the dividends than just the regular QUAT factor grades.

645
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,600
So definitely recommend checking those out on the platform.

646
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,160
And another great thing is that the profitability grade has improved from an F to a C plus just

647
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,200
over the past three months.

648
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,200
So similar to how Steve showed you the improvement with the valuation grade,

649
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,960
we're seeing the same improvements in profitability while the share price remains relatively the same.

650
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,160
And as you said, good yield there, 2.2% yield, which is significantly higher than the S&P 500.

651
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,240
Our beverage company?

652
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,240
Yes. Next up, we have Compagnia Severasurias.

653
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,000
It is a beverage company out of Chile at 2.8 billion.

654
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,600
It's a little bit smaller, consumer staples and specifically in the brewing industry,

655
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,760
but they do make soft drinks, bottled water.

656
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,480
They're pretty diversified across the whole beverage sphere.

657
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,840
Currently, it's ranked number four out of all consumer staples stocks by our QUAT system,

658
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,400
but it's number one out of its industry.

659
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,520
And because this is a foreign stock, we don't have the forward dividend yield,

660
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,320
but we do have the trailing, which is 2.97%.

661
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,040
And it's up 33.7 year to date.

662
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,360
Something to note about this stock in particular, this actually made another top 10 list of ours

663
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,560
when we're talking about foreign stocks that investors are rotating into because of

664
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,240
all the turmoil that's been going on in the markets the past few months.

665
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,960
So if you want to hear about other international stocks, I think I saw somebody ask a question

666
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,520
in the comments already about whether we recommend going into foreign stocks.

667
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,200
There is a much more comprehensive list under Steve's profile in an article published last week.

668
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,600
And another highlight, 8% forward return on equity growth, which is a 12,093% difference,

669
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,400
very impressive.

670
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,640
And we have a trailing PEG that's price to earnings growth ratio, a very favored metric of ours,

671
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,960
because it gives you a really good glimpse into valuation on a deeper level than just maybe the

672
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,920
PE. And that comes at a 66% discount to the sector median.

673
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,600
So definitely a good price for the performance.

674
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,600
And something else I'll highlight on this, if you look at the card on the right hand side in the

675
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:37,200
quant rating history, you'll see that our quant system, I'm going to say it's somewhere around

676
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,080
the November, December timeframe, it went from a hold to a strong buy.

677
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,640
And you can see it really nailed it almost at the bottom there going to that buy,

678
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,040
because it has climbed significantly from that price to where it is today.

679
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,720
So quant system really did a great job on selecting that stock.

680
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,040
Our next stock, Alexander.

681
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,840
Definitely.

682
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,640
I just saw a question pop up on how to find Steve's profile.

683
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,520
So if you just type in Stephen Kress into the main search bar on the Seeking Alpha website,

684
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,960
you can click on his profile.

685
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,200
And then there's a section that says analysis, and you can find every single article that he's

686
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,800
ever written in order.

687
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,400
So if you're just getting started on the quant system, that is a really good place to begin.

688
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,400
So here we have a REIT, it's called Alexander and Baldwin.

689
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,560
It's $1.25 billion.

690
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,040
It's specifically considered a diversified REIT.

691
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,760
So if you look into our REIT coverage, we usually like to have a different range of

692
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,640
different types of REITs.

693
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,720
But this one was the biggest standout to us when it comes to the stocks that are performing well

694
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,320
in the so-called Trump slump.

695
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,080
So it has a forward dividend yield of 5.14.

696
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,200
That's really good.

697
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,600
Obviously, that's why REITs are a great option for diversifying in a down market.

698
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,320
This one's interesting because it's based in Honolulu.

699
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:01,760
So it actually covers all types of different developments across the island and not only

700
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,280
just tourism, which is the biggest industry, but other industries as well.

701
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,800
So it's very diversified.

702
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,720
And it has a 77% forward FFO payout ratio, a five-year compound annual growth rate of 5.3%,

703
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:24,080
and forward AFFO growth rate of 7.7%, which is a 182% premium to the 2.75% sex year median.

704
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,880
Now, for sake of time, I'm not going over every single metric and its difference from the sector

705
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,640
median, but highly recommend checking out the quant system for yourself.

706
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,760
It's going to give you tons and tons of data on valuation, growth, profitability, momentum,

707
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,920
and revision so you can explore that for yourself.

708
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,600
Next up, we have another REIT.

709
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,320
This is called CARE trust, and it's specifically a focus on the health care sector.

710
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,440
So it's 1.25 billion.

711
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,360
There's a forward dividend yield of 4.7%, so again, very juicy dividend yield there.

712
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,000
This is more focused than the previous REIT.

713
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,040
It is just skilled nursing facilities and senior housing properties, which are a really lucrative

714
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,920
business right now.

715
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:15,760
If you look at some of the quant metrics, we have FFO growth of 10%, which is a 271% premium

716
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,800
to the sector median in terms of valuation.

717
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,040
There's also a forward PE of 19.71, which represents a 42% discount to the sector median

718
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,280
even given its above average momentum and great performance that we're seeing.

719
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
So highly recommend this one as well.

720
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,800
All right.

721
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,040
Now, Francesca, on to our growth stocks.

722
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,400
So as we mentioned, it's a barbell approach.

723
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,480
The stocks that we just went over, those four stocks, offered really nice dividend yields.

724
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,640
Again, that yield affords you a little bit of cushion as the market sell off.

725
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,680
You're getting paid to wait.

726
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,120
But our approach again is a barbell approach.

727
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,800
We don't want you to miss out on stocks that have come off sharply that have great fundamentals.

728
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
So Francesca is going to tell you about a few of those.

729
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,160
Exactly.

730
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,400
It's all about growth at a reasonable price.

731
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,560
So the first one we have on our growth list is App Lovin.

732
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,760
Right now, its market cap is $92.6 billion, at least when this slide was made this morning.

733
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,720
Of course, there's a lot of action with this particular stock that has been oscillating a lot.

734
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,680
It's technically in the IT sector and the application software industry.

735
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:34,960
It is a platform that helps digital advertisers reach their audiences with AI and all types of

736
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,240
other technologies.

737
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:44,160
So some of the highlights, we see revenue growth of 43%, EBIT growth year over year of 189%

738
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:53,360
versus the 10% sector median, and levered FCF growth of 61% versus the 15% sector median.

739
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:00,320
So there's a ton of great growth, a ton of great profitability, momentum speaks for itself,

740
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:08,480
and the valuation right now compared to all of those A-level characteristics is a great price.

741
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Now, this one has been a bit controversial because there have been some short reports

742
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,080
that have come out on it, but I'll let Steve jump in quickly with his take.

743
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,200
Yeah, a lot of times when you have companies that have done really, really well,

744
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,000
there'll be a couple firms that are names that you've never even heard of.

745
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,440
In this case, it's like Buddy Waters or it could be like Fuzzy Bear.

746
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,080
And they tend to really conclude with hedge funds.

747
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,680
They issue reports that have negative information.

748
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,640
Sometimes that's a lot of false information.

749
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,680
Sometimes it's a lot of information taken out of context.

750
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:53,120
The point that I want to highlight here is we look at the top tier firms for our forward growth

751
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,800
numbers. And our model basically looks at historical numbers and forward numbers.

752
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,920
The forward numbers are taken from Wall Street Consensus.

753
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,360
And Wall Street Consensus on the stock has 19 analysts in the last 90 days that have taken

754
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,680
their earnings revisions up and only one professional analyst has taken it down.

755
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,560
So we often get questions about these short reports and we tell people we tend to go with

756
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:23,840
a professional analyst who really know these companies. So we're not putting much in terms of

757
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:30,080
our weight or really nothing in terms of weight towards what Muddy Waters was saying in their

758
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,920
short report. But again, there's so many of these companies that try to collude with hedge funds.

759
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,080
And they say right in the reports that they have positions in these companies where they're short.

760
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,240
So we try not to pay too much attention. We think Applevin has some excellent fundamentals.

761
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:51,040
And in fact, they were one of the companies that just recently announced that they wanted to be

762
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,560
a buyer of TikTok. So on that announcement, the stock itself, App Lovin, was up about 10%.

763
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,400
So very interesting.

764
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,360
And one second, actually, we got to address this real fast because we talk about transparency

765
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,000
all the time. So if you don't mind, can we go to our platform real quick?

766
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,960
Absolutely.

767
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,320
So App actually flipped to a hold today. And I was hoping you could take a quick second to show

768
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,920
the change of the valuation of the factor grade and what has worked like that. So if you want to

769
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,280
go into the quant history, maybe just walk people through what happened real fast.

770
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,640
All right. So we're in our platform. And I did this a little bit too quickly. So we put an

771
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,920
APP, it brings App Lovin up right away. And the beauty of our platform is you not only have the

772
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,560
quant metrics on the right side and the ranking of where it is in the industry. And as Daniel

773
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:44,080
highlighted, actually moved to a hold. And it had been strong by yesterday. And we could tell you

774
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:50,240
right now, the reason why it's gone to hold is the valuation grade actually dropped to a D minus.

775
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:58,320
So one of our sort of circuit breakers within our system is if evaluation grade does go to a D minus,

776
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:05,840
it will default to a hold. But I will highlight, this has a most straight A in terms of report

777
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,880
card for growth, profitability, momentum and revisions. It was that valuation grade that

778
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,160
took it down. In terms of transparency, which Daniel is highlighting, you can click on a ratings

779
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:23,760
tab that we have. And this will show you for every single stock that we cover every single day

780
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,160
with the directional recommendation is, with the quant score is, and with the valuation grades are.

781
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,600
So you can see here, this was holding in the strong by camp. There's been a lot of volatility

782
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,240
with it recently. But you can see on the valuation grade, it had been D, D, D, and then it flipped to

783
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:50,400
D minus. Now, chances are with the stock price coming down as much as it has today, 9.78%.

784
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,120
This could actually flip back from a D minus to D, which will take it back to strong by.

785
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:03,280
It's important to keep in mind, okay, this is a data driven process, it operates on numbers.

786
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,080
So when numbers move, there's a certain threshold that will occur where stocks will flip for valuation,

787
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:16,480
growth, profitability. That's kind of the beauty of the system. It's not emotional. It's based on the

788
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,600
data. But if you follow the data, you have to keep in mind stocks trade every single day,

789
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:27,760
valuation levels change every day, growth levels change every day. So anything that has a ratio,

790
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:33,440
that changes multiple times a day. So the quant system takes that into account. It's a real time

791
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,560
system. So the benefit is when you're making investment decision, you're making that investment

792
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:44,000
decision on real time knowledge, as opposed to an article that could be written, you know, by

793
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,880
Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs, that could be four weeks old or eight weeks old. Nobody wants

794
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,280
to make an investment decision based on information from a research report that was written two months

795
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,200
ago. And that's the benefit of our quant system. But sometimes, since it follows every single trade,

796
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,800
which comes through to every ratio, you will have fluctuations like that. And most importantly,

797
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,880
I say a hold is a hold. The hold does not mean sell. Okay, we have cells and strong cells.

798
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,080
That's when you sell stock. A hold means that it's likely to perform in line with the industry.

799
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,920
So you hold on to the position. I'm going to take us back to our platform.

800
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,920
Thanks for clarifying that, Steve. We had to address that real quick for everybody now

801
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,760
to hand it back to Francesca about it. Thanks, guys. Yeah, it is crazy how these markets can

802
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,440
shift on a dime. And just in the period of less than 12 hours, we're going from strong buy to hold.

803
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,680
And I think that's a great lesson in terms of when you're reading our content as well.

804
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,960
Sometimes we'll put off these articles and then an hour later, boom, the quant rating can shift.

805
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,360
So always check things out on the system for yourself. But it is great that it's

806
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:56,160
measuring everything in real time. So next up is a crowd favorite of the quant team,

807
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,200
Brinker International. That is the restaurant company behind Chili's, probably their most famous.

808
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,760
They also own a chain called Maggiano's Little Italy. It has market cap of 6.6 billion,

809
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,360
consumer discretionary in the restaurant industry, as I said. And it's currently ranked

810
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,000
number one of all restaurants and number four of all consumer discretionary. So very impressive

811
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,360
rankings there. It makes sense considering that the shares have rallied 182% over the past year,

812
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,720
which is impressive considering what the markets have been through just in 2025.

813
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,760
So they had great performance in Q4, 26% boost in annual revenues, and they nearly tripled their

814
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,760
profitability. That's due to a lot of things. They rebranded themselves. They've put out a

815
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,440
lot of emphasis on social media. If you've ever heard of the Chili's triple dipper, that's Vibral

816
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,440
on TikTok. They're doing incredible things when it comes to getting their name out there. And

817
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:03,680
also it's very affordable. They actually lowered the cost of their food in Q2 despite increasing

818
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,000
inflation. So it's really a crowd favorite with customers and investors. And looking a little

819
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,600
deeper into the quant metrics, price to earnings growth, like we said, that's a favorite valuation

820
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:22,480
of ours. It's 0.5, which represents a 64% discount to the sector. So you're getting a lot of bang

821
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:32,480
for your buck here. They have long-term EPS growth of 37.6%, which comes in at a 233% difference to

822
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:40,640
the sector. So C-minus valuation, as Steve has explained, those shift a lot. But in the grand

823
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:47,200
scheme of things, a C-minus can still represent a really good discount, especially when you're looking

824
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,640
at straight A pluses across all of our other quant categories. Especially with the peg ratio

825
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,600
that comes under that valuation. Sometimes you'll have the conventional metrics like PE will be

826
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:04,000
really expensive. But I love the peg metric, which is it combines the PE with the growth rate,

827
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,360
and it gives you a much greater sense of reality when you combine growth with PE. And often in

828
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,280
companies where the overall value grade could be your D or D minus, sometimes that peg ratio will be

829
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,600
an A, A minus A plus. Something to highlight here too, not only is Brinko a favorite with a

830
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:27,840
quant team in the last 90 days, you have had 20 analysts revise their estimates up and zero have

831
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:35,440
revised it down. Yeah, that's a pretty good case. Yeah. Thank you. So next up we have TG

832
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:42,400
Therapeutics. This is a biotech company in the healthcare sector. And they're most known for

833
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:50,720
their drugs for B cell medicated diseases, including multiple sclerosis. So they're a leader in that

834
00:58:50,720 --> 00:59:01,600
very important field. Looking at the quant metrics, forward EPS gap growth of 179% comes out of 1169%

835
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:08,160
difference to the sector. So really impressive growth compared to everywhere else in the healthcare

836
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:15,200
sector. And with five upward EPS revisions compared to one negative, seems like Wall

837
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,400
Street is relatively aligned with our strong buy assessment. And if you just take a look at the

838
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,400
factor grades, everything's in the green. So definitely take a look at the quant system and

839
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,720
poke through those numbers a little bit more, but really impressive metrics across the board.

840
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Yeah, and you can see actually the valuation, it has improved to be minus from where it was

841
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,120
six months ago at a D minus, and the growth is still A plus. So that really makes it quite attractive.

842
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:51,200
All right. Oh, thank you. All right. So last but not least, we have Lifetime Group. If you're

843
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,200
familiar with the Lifetime Fitness Gems, we see them around here in New York. They have a market

844
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,680
capitalization of 6.6 billion. It's technically in the leisure facilities industry as categorized in

845
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,840
our quant system. And it's ranked number one out of that industry and number six out of all consumer

846
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,880
discretionary sectors. So just like Brinker International, it is a leader in that category.

847
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,320
And it's one of the categories that has been doing exceedingly well as investors are rotating

848
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:27,520
into more defensive, non-cyclical stocks, which could be utilities, healthcare, consumer discretionary.

849
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:34,960
So it is a luxury fitness chain with 175 clubs across the US and 1.5 million members. We've

850
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,680
seen those numbers really improve since COVID. Of course, a lot of these companies had to shudder

851
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:47,040
gems during the pandemic. And it's been a long road to restoring profitability. And Lifetime has

852
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,560
been able to pull that off in part because they transformed their real estate strategy. So instead

853
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,720
of buying properties themselves and shelling out to build these luxury gems, they're working with

854
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,320
existing landlords. And they figured out a way to kind of make the whole thing way more cost-efficient.

855
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:11,360
And looking at the quant metrics, we have forward EPS gap growth of 59%, which is a 624%

856
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:18,160
difference to the sector median, as well as forward EBITDA growth of 18%, which is a 283%

857
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,160
difference. And Steve just explained why he loves Peg. We all love Peg here on the quant team. And

858
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:31,600
it has a trailing Peg of 0.41, which represents more than a 42% discount from the sector. And if

859
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,840
you look at the valuation, you can see it has improved a little bit over the past six months

860
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,600
from a D minus to a D plus. And Francesca, I can tell you as a member of Lifetime Group,

861
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:49,840
I am incredibly impressed with their facilities. They do a fantastic job there. And I got to say,

862
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,800
if people have to tighten their belt and times get tough, I will cut out a couple of restaurants

863
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,520
before I cut out by fitness facility. So I think other people probably feel the same way.

864
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:05,520
All right. I think that brings us to Q&A. So Daniel, I'm going to hand it over to you for

865
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,080
the questions, because I know we have had a ton of questions come through.

866
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,600
Yeah, we're running out of time here. I'd love to get to some of the questions here in the chat. So

867
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,240
if you don't mind doing that, we can pause on for another time. But one of the questions that came

868
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,480
to light was recommending certain stocks and sectors that typically don't do well in market

869
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,120
environments during a pullback. You think about consumer discretionary, it comes top of mind.

870
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,280
But you're always finding these stocks that are strong buys within that sector. So I think

871
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,680
somebody's just wondering, how is it that the quantum system can still recommend

872
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,800
these stocks and sectors that are usually hit the hardest?

873
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,560
Yeah. So really, what you have to do is not pay attention to the sector rotation. What we want

874
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:53,600
to do is pay attention to companies that have really strong fundamentals. And often the companies

875
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,240
that have strong fundamentals can be technology companies that can be industrial companies

876
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,960
or consumer discretionary companies. So the fact that the stocks have been sold off

877
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,920
has more to do with a rotation to the safe havens than some of the fundamentals with these companies.

878
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,240
So what we want to do is identify companies that have incredibly strong growth rates

879
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,160
and good valuation frameworks. So a perfect example is, I actually want to take you to

880
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:30,640
a slide that I have from AlphaPix here. So AlphaPix is a separate service that we run.

881
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,640
Try to find stocks on your own that could be difficult in good times and in certain times

882
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,680
like this could be even harder. But what I want to point out with AlphaPix, we happen to have a

883
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,360
lot of companies that are IT stocks and consumer discretionary stocks. So if you look at the growth

884
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:56,240
metrics, for the AlphaPix portfolio, the revenue growth is 13.8% compared to the S&P, which has

885
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:06,640
a revenue growth of 5.4%. The EPS growth for AlphaPix is 36% for EPS growth versus the S&P at 13%.

886
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:15,280
And yet the P e-multiple is only 18 times versus the S&P at 23 times. So you're getting a case here

887
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,640
where you almost have an earnings growth rate that's three times greater than this S&P, but yet

888
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,840
it's a cheaper valuation. So that's exactly what we want to do. We want to identify the companies

889
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,560
that have strong growth rates and good valuation frameworks because over time,

890
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:38,960
fear fades and the market will return to fundamentals. So that's why especially in periods like this,

891
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,320
you could use this uncertainty as your best friend. And if you identify these stocks now,

892
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,640
when the fear settles down and the market does return to fundamentals, you will definitely be

893
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,000
rewarded by it. Right, Lee said. All right, I'm going to squeeze one more in here actually because

894
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,520
as I mentioned, we're going to wrap up because we're past five o'clock here. But when it comes to us

895
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,600
coming on these webinars, I saw this question, it comes up all the time. We're always recommending

896
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,480
stocks to pick and we're always saying, well, okay, it's the strong buy and it's the garp system.

897
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,160
Maybe just take a second to remind people what the garp system is because I think people are

898
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,400
naturally thinking about, well, if you're saying it's buy this stock now, then the market must be

899
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,360
bottoming. Right, I think that's the natural thought people have. So when we come here and we

900
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:29,280
say, here's a list of eight stocks today, maybe just give them the compelling explanation of

901
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:36,560
the growth at a reasonable price. Right, exactly. So we're not saying that the market has bottomed

902
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,880
here yet. But what we're saying is the pullback has been significant enough that you probably want

903
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,720
to start paying attention to these companies that have incredible fundamentals. So when we look at

904
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:54,240
garp growth at a reasonable price, we're looking for companies that have strong growth rates at a

905
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:00,240
reasonable valuation. And I think really to highlight this, so a lot of people are moving into

906
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:07,840
consumer stable stocks right now. So look at the EPS, the average EPS growth rate for alpha picks

907
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:16,960
is 36%. Okay, and I highlighted compared to the S&P, it's 13%. But this is a 36% EPS growth rate.

908
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,960
So I'm going to take us to our platform so you can see what the growth rate is for a sector that

909
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,960
people are going to, which is consumer staples. So here we have 36% for alpha picks. So I'm going to

910
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:35,040
go to Pepsi, which is actually a stock that we do have in alpha picks. But what I want to highlight

911
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:42,320
is I'm going to click on growth. And we're going to look at the EPS growth rate. So for the consumer

912
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:52,000
stable sector, the growth rate is 8%. Okay, so as an investor, wouldn't you want to be investing

913
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,680
in companies that have a growth rate that's 36% as opposed to growth rate that's only 8% and in the

914
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:06,080
same token, the multiple for the alpha picks portfolio is 18 times. And we go to the multiple

915
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:13,600
for the consumer stable sector. Okay, it's actually on a trailing basis, it's 21 times,

916
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:21,600
on a forward basis, it's 19 times. So the average PE for the alpha picks portfolio is 18 times.

917
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,240
It's actually at a discount to the consumer stable sector. So this is a sector that people

918
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,160
are flying to. And the reason why they're flying to it is consumer stable companies tend to have

919
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,960
very stable earnings, no matter what the environment is, people are still going to need to drink,

920
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,520
they're still going to have their beverages, they're still going to have to buy certain foods.

921
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,240
So that's why they tend to go to that, or they'll go to the utility sector because they need to keep

922
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,600
the lights out of the house. Okay, but you're looking at growth rates that are much, much lower.

923
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:55,520
And valuations at this point, which are actually more expensive than stocks that we consider

924
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,480
attractive. So again, in alpha picks, we have something, we have about 38 stocks in the portfolio.

925
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:08,320
And of the 38 stocks, the average EPS growth is 36%. The average PE is 18 times, that is actually

926
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:15,440
at a discount to consumer staples with a growth rate that's triple, more than triple the consumer

927
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,600
stable sector. So, Daniel, hopefully that answers your question. Daniel, I think, you know, maybe

928
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,760
we can take a couple more questions. It's a pretty hectic day. I know we normally like to keep these

929
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,080
to an hour, but some people might want to hang on a little bit longer. So, you know,

930
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,520
ask away with a couple more questions. Well, then let's go back to the platform real quick.

931
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:38,880
I got one for you. So a company like Nike got demolished today off of the tariff news. And I

932
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,040
think this is a compelling case that you can maybe walk us through not only the quant system here,

933
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,440
but also focus on the dividend grades and kind of give us a look into what you're seeing here.

934
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,600
Okay. Well, from a quant system, it does have a hold on the stock, but not all holds are created

935
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,480
equal. So, one of the things I can tell you that doesn't look really attractive about Nike is you

936
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,560
do have that valuation grade at a D. But what is not great is the growth grade is an F. So, let's

937
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:12,320
take it's one click away. You can see these underlying metrics. The reason why Nike has an

938
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:18,960
F for growth is the year over year growth rate is actually negative 7.3%. And the forward growth

939
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,800
rate is negative 3%. So, the top line growth for this company is negative. If we look at

940
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:32,880
some of the bottom line EBITDA numbers, the EBITDA growth is negative 15% year over year. And forward,

941
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:40,800
it is negative 13%. So, growth does not look good for this company. And the forward growth rate

942
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:46,240
is negative. So, Nike is really not an attractive stock. So, when you throw the tariffs on top of

943
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,400
it, this is the picture of it free tariffs. Okay. Now you throw the tariffs on top of it.

944
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,720
Growth just does not look good for a company like Nike. And this is kind of what the quant

945
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:02,640
system is telling you. So, we like stocks that look good on a guard basis, growth at a reasonable

946
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,480
price. Nike would not fit that because the growth is in the negative domain and the valuation is

947
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:15,360
expensive. So, this would not make a quant strong buy. Thanks for that. So, there was a question

948
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:21,360
about the slide you shared earlier about the median time of a market pullback and coming

949
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,200
down to August 9th is the date that they're saying give or take. So, they're asking why not wait until

950
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:36,640
August to invest in stocks? Why start buying stocks now? Okay. So, one of the examples that I

951
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:45,920
showed is we went back to the beginning of 2010. There have been five market pullbacks of 15% at

952
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:54,160
that point. So, when the market is down 15%, if you held it for two years, we showed you on average,

953
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:01,280
if you took advantage of the top 10 quant stocks, it was up 117%. The S&P was up 50%. So, when it's

954
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:07,840
down 15%, that's actually a good point to start dipping your toes in the water and start looking

955
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,000
for some of these stocks. Particularly, if the market is down 15%, the stocks that have probably

956
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,800
the quant strong buys are down even more because a lot of them started coming off in early January

957
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,680
and February pretty significantly. You may recall I said the quant is like a Richter scale.

958
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,360
When we have stocks that we've identified as strong buys that are really attractive

959
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,120
and that have had good run-ups on momentum, they'll sometimes be the first things that get sold.

960
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,280
People will take profits where they've made money as they look to put it into cash or to

961
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,040
consumer staples or gold. So, chances are a number of the stocks that we've liked probably have already

962
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,320
sold off more than the market. So, using that level for the market as a benchmark at down 15%

963
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,760
is usually a fairly good time to start putting your toes back in the water. But certainly, I'd

964
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,400
say be patient. If you have powder on the sideline, just use a little bit of it. I would especially

965
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,600
say if you have stocks that are speculative companies where there are no earnings growth,

966
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,760
where the earnings could be negative, you might want to move out of some of those speculative

967
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,080
investments and put the money into stocks that have dividends or stocks that have really good

968
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,160
fundamentals. This is definitely not a good period for speculative investments. You probably have

969
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:29,920
noticed a lot of the Russell stocks, the small cap stocks have sold off considerably from its 52

970
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:36,160
eKai and that's because there's so much uncertainty with inflation. With tariffs, it brings inflation.

971
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,600
There's always that scarcity value that interest rates are going to have to move up if you have

972
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,480
inflation. Small caps don't do well during that period. So, if you have small cap stocks that

973
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,760
have limited probability, you may want to choose to sell some of those stocks to have some cash

974
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,680
put into the quality stocks. One last question here. People are asking the

975
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,920
quant system, how do they know when to sell the stock? Because these are all strong buys,

976
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:06,240
when do they know to sell? Well, when the quant grade goes to sell or a strong sell, that's how

977
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:13,200
you know. A little bit different from what I said early on, where the quant system could often be

978
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:19,600
like a richer scale. It gives me that sign, like I start to see volatilities in our strong buy

979
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,600
stocks that have performed extraordinarily well. They start selling off and when they sell off in

980
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,680
size, and not size like just being one company, but like a big bread of the stock start to sell off,

981
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:37,040
it notifies me that there's a rotation that's starting to occur. That doesn't mean sell those

982
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,960
stocks. That means the fundamentals are actually getting more and more attractive as the stocks

983
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,560
are getting cheaper. But for a stock that you buy as a quant, what you really want to know to sell it,

984
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,200
it's when the directional recommendation changes to sell or strong sell.

985
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,320
Perfect. And I know that's a strategy you use within the AlphaPix portfolio, right? So maybe

986
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,040
you just want to take a second and just kind of tell people about that. Yeah. So we will sort of

987
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:08,160
end on that. I mentioned the AlphaPix portfolio. So investing, it often requires a lot of time.

988
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,680
You could be a sophisticated or an engaged investor, or you could be a beginner. Time is often

989
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:19,840
limited. So what we do with AlphaPix is every month we take our top two quant recommendations,

990
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,240
and we bring it forward on the trading date closest to the first of the month and the 15th

991
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:30,800
of the month. We send out an article on some of our top quant stocks. And we started this about

992
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,280
a little more than two and a half years ago, and you could see the performance has been exceptional.

993
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:43,680
AlphaPix is up 129% versus the S&P up 48%. And I could say pretty consistently since inception,

994
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,120
whether you look at a one month time frame or one year time frame or six months,

995
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:57,520
it's our perform. I will say in the last month that has changed. And since February, a lot of our

996
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,720
AlphaPix stocks have gotten completely clobbered. But again, it doesn't have anything to do with

997
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,680
the results. So I've grayed out most of the names here, but we just finished up our recent

998
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:15,440
earnings period. And we saw that 87% of the AlphaPix stocks beat earnings estimates that were out

999
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:21,680
there from Wall Street analysts versus the S&P 500, where only 75% of the stock had beaten

1000
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:28,080
analysts expectations. So it's a really positive sign. And what you can see here is a list of all

1001
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:35,360
the companies with the EPS surprise. So almost every one of them beat analysts expectations

1002
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,640
in the most recent quarter. And pretty much the same for the top line.

1003
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,800
Really, some of them, two of them were just off minimally. You're talking about companies that

1004
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,600
make billions of dollars. So to be like 9 million off of like 3.7 billion is really like a non-event.

1005
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,960
So for the most part, these companies really did great off of the last earnings period beating

1006
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,200
both top and bottom line expectations. But many of these stocks have gotten crushed since February,

1007
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:09,600
bringing down the returns of AlphaPix. So again, uncertainty can be your best friend.

1008
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,200
You want to take advantage. You want to invest in companies that have strong growth rates,

1009
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,040
top line and bottom line. And that's what we bring forward with AlphaPix. But markets come down.

1010
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:24,400
There's nothing we could do about it. But what you can do is take advantage of the opportunity

1011
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,160
that it presents. And we've shown many examples in this presentation going back to 1929,

1012
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:37,200
for the duration that markets come off, how much they come off, but how much they appreciate

1013
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:42,560
in the period following when they've had that decline. And that's really what it comes down to

1014
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:51,280
here today is don't let fear get the best of you. Be a disciplined investor. And look to make

1015
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,080
structural moves at this point where you find stocks with good fundamentals. Because the more

1016
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,960
the market comes off here, the greater your return is going to be. And it doesn't take that long.

1017
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,640
Okay. Even during the Great Depression, when the market had its biggest move down, 89% in a two-year

1018
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:12,560
period, had you invested one year later, you would have been up over 100%. And we found the same thing

1019
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:18,720
during the pandemic. We found the same thing during the financial crisis. And we're going to find it

1020
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:25,680
into the future as well. Steve, Francesca, we can't thank you enough. Obviously, as I mentioned

1021
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:31,200
at the top, probably the most important webinar we have ever done with the markets that we're in.

1022
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,160
I mean, this has been incredible. Thank you so much for taking the time to put all this data

1023
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,080
together, walk us through the history, present these stocks, walk us through the metrics,

1024
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,160
walk us through the platform. There's been a lot of positive comments coming into the chat.

1025
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:46,080
And anybody watching the replay, I hope you learned something as well. Highly encourage you

1026
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,000
to go follow Stephen's profile here on Seeking Alpha to read all of his analysis,

1027
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,040
check out AlphaPix, and we'll see you here soon in the next video. Thank you so much, everybody.

1028
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,480
Thanks, everyone.
