1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
It's like my family. I definitely have no subjects.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
Hey Daniel, hey Eric.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,960
Welcome back.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
Thanks so much. Yeah, it's great to be here.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,640
Hi Virginia.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,640
No.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
All right, let's kick off.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,840
I wanted to start out with some reminders.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,360
First, we have a book club coming up on inspired in four weeks.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,880
On August 7th, I just re-read it myself.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,400
It's a good read.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,440
It's highly aligned with how I think about product management and does a good job of explaining

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
why some of these things are important.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,720
That I also believe to be important.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,800
So it's nice to have another voice explaining all of that.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
So please do read that.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,680
I think I'm going to update the new hire on boarding dock and ask all new

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
hires to read this as well so that we all, everybody in the team is on the same page with

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
respect to this book.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's see.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
Reminder B.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,000
Remember there's this interview spreadsheet.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
CS and sales have populated that with the number of customer

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
contacts for meetings.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
Please do follow up on that.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,360
I want to ensure goodwill with that team and follow up promptly with meetings with these

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,640
customers so that that team can see that we're taking advantage of it.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
Third reminder, we've got a little engagement survey.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm going to run this once a month in Q3.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,480
Just to take a pulse given all the change going on, please do take a minute to fill it out.

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,200
It's five.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,400
Quick questions and then one free form where you can share whatever feedback you have.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
Fabian didn't receive it.

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm pretty sure I went through my emails.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,120
I think I was some maybe it's on my end but I'm happy to fill it out.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,920
But I didn't get it.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Need to get it to you.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
All right, I will I'll ask Jessica to recent that to you.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Anybody else in the same condition where you did not receive it?

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,040
I don't recall but is there a way to put the link to the survey in the agenda?

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
Well, it's it's personal.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,840
It's it's tied back to your user ID so we can track which team are on and that kind of thing.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
I do believe it's anonymous but nevertheless everyone has their own customer ID.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
So I'll ask Jessica to send it to Fabian and Karina.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Anybody else?

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,520
I just I hadn't seen it.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Scott, but I searched my email real quick and it looks like that's the title of the email.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
So if you just searched for that in your your email, you should be able to find it if you got it.

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Paul's survey.

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Culture ramp.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,080
Okay.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
Anybody else didn't get it?

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,600
Please ping me.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,040
All right.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,440
Next reminder we we need we have a goal of at least three customer interviews per PM.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
There's an okay R issue out there.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
If you haven't updated it lately, please do so.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
And remember we have three weeks until Q2 to hit our goals.

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,760
A please please do invest the time to get those set up and get at least three done if you haven't already.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
Next one category maturity page last week.

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,320
We talked about this Josh did a great job of creating some new views.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,880
One of which is sort of this flow chart showing how mature we're going to be at a given point in time,

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,400
which raised questions about whether we were forecasting that accurately.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,160
If you haven't already, please go in and either confirm that it's accurate or update it.

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,440
Thanks to Kenny for creating that issue.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,520
Somebody added direction maturity page.

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,440
No talk about that.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,880
Well, I would just mean just a few ear offensive songs add in the link there.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,320
That's also folks in the scene the updates there for the charts.

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,200
I just check it out.

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
So got it.

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,760
So it's a good way you can get a sense for like, you know.

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,160
It's hard when it's in tabular form, but when it's charted, it's much easier to see.

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
Like if it's achievable or not based on some of the trends.

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
And there's also fiscal down stays level trends as well.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
So you can see higher stage in particular is trending or said to be trending.

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:42,960
So.

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,000
Great. Thanks, Josh.

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,440
All right, some team updates. We hired a couple more PMs. We got a good rhythm going on hiring.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,760
We hired Gabe Weaver. He originally came through. They growth funnel.

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
But we have a really strong candidate for that fourth slot.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
So we're going to target Gabe for third managed PM.

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,000
The chart or that team is to be defined. But bottom line. We're going to have a third group in the

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,400
managed area. And Gabe will lead that. And then dove, her skivets. We just hired him.

85
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,280
As the APM monitoring, he's got a great background in monitoring. And it's most recently been

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,960
elastic. So thank you to everyone who's been involved in the hiring loop. I know it's

87
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:39,760
taking a lot of energy from everybody. But I think our hiring processes continues to pick up speed.

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Be to be worked with with Christy and David Sakamoto to change in language around customer

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,760
results. Just want to make sure you all saw that. So there's the MR.

90
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,760
It's got on that one. I just the there's a the diff highlights what is new content. I believe.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,040
And there's one section that is great. I can totally understand why I would add that about prioritize

92
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,360
ruthlessly. But then the rest is I guess a bunch of formatting changes. And I don't know if there's

93
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,040
new content in any of the dog feeding. I guess the TLDR, the addition of that prioritize ruthlessly,

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,520
or is there some other point we were trying to make in this change?

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:33,040
It's been a little while. I think there were a number of changes. But before the handbook basically

96
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,880
read that internal feedback is worth 10 times more than external feedback. And I understand why we want

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,400
internal feedback because of dog fooding and using our own product. It's a it's a great channel

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,080
for feedback. But I think it was sending the message that customers weren't nearly as important

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,400
as internal opinion. And both Christy and I want to move off of that position. Like we should be

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,080
customer first and treat our own teams as a customer. But I don't want people to interpret that

101
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,960
our own internal opinion as worth 10 times more than a customer's opinion. If that makes sense.

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,200
So it is mostly language wherever that showed up in the handbook.

103
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,080
Catch it. Okay. The one comment I had on this is that some of the text seems like we should

104
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,000
focus on core competencies as opposed to new scope. And like as in the we should focus

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,120
for what we're about to add. So anyway that's one thought I had on this.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,480
What? I don't remember that being the point of it. Maybe it reads that way. I don't know.

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,880
Feel free to continue to suggest tweaks. The point was let's prioritize and do what matters most first.

108
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,240
Just it's kind of what I've been preaching the whole time. Like let's in your area.

109
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Wherever that is, do what matters first. Don't try to do it all. At once, we're going to have to

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:09,200
work our way through. That was the point. Yeah. I don't know if this is a follow-up issue.

111
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,320
And the way you described it, it doesn't seem controversial. But I will say there was a big

112
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,840
discussion and a recent initiative from Sid and other leaders that we should heavily prioritize

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,680
dog-fruiting because there were parts that are teams within the company that were not

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,600
utilizing our features. And we wanted to make sure that the product team was responsive to requests

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,360
from them. It's a little bit different than saying it's about our internal opinion. We should

116
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
we had always said we should validate it. That clarification is good that we want to make sure

117
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
it's about us saying this is in line with where we want to take the product and where we're

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,280
hearing customers. But if the internal customer wants it, we should, the original thinking was that

119
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,640
we should emphasize it. If the intent was to make sure we were just clarifying that same position.

120
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,720
But if we're saying, actually, we should pull back from the push for more dog-fruiting.

121
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,440
No. Maybe a different one. I would. Please don't conflate the two.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,400
We very much still want a dog food. I think the point is when you're thinking of customers for

123
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,600
your thing, think of our internal teams early. You can get great feedback from them. They have an

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,320
incentive to work with you. There's very little risk in rolling out things early to them.

125
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,400
So treat them like a customer and think of our internal teams early as you're rolling something out.

126
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:42,720
That's still very much the message. But let's not over-rotate on internal feedback or internal

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,240
opinion. Let's still seek external feedback too because that's just one customer of many.

128
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
Cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. It does.

129
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
All right. Two C customer training, discovery training coming soon.

130
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,400
Sarah O'Donnell and her team are going to do a bunch of sort of quick videos on a variety of customer

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,440
discovery topics. So super excited for that. They should start dropping any day now. I think starting this week.

132
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,680
And so we'll release those two as they come out. We'll embed them in the how we work

133
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:30,400
description or team page as well. All right. Number three, 12, two. Kick off feedback. Josh,

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,320
thanks for leaving the charge. I thought you did a good job of MCing and sort of adding

135
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,560
color commentary in between. I thought the screenshots definitely helped.

136
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,760
There were a bunch that did not have them. I was wondering why is it just because we're not

137
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,040
there yet on many of these? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean some of the commentary I don't know,

138
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,960
or Nicole added that. Yeah. Many of the issues we're saying we're going to do UX, front end and back

139
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,400
in the same iteration. So it hasn't started. And in some, I can think of a number of where

140
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,120
they're just aren't appropriate screenshots or at least there weren't screenshots or mockups

141
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
created in advance. Okay. For the purposes of front end working on it because front end was going

142
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,840
to work on it without a mockup. Okay. I love to get to where we're a bit ahead. So we'll have more

143
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,320
of these earlier and hopefully the customer discovery flow will get us further ahead on that.

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,880
In my case, some of the features also just have no UX component as a no UI component that could be

145
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,520
speech or it's understood. Yeah. I don't expect everyone. I mean, user judgment if it doesn't

146
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,800
need it fine. But where we do need design, it'd be great to get at least a month ahead. So

147
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,160
as we roll into dev, we have that to offer them. Scott, just a quick question to you. How do you

148
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,600
feel about presenting like balsamic or super low-fi mockups on the kickoff call? Find with that.

149
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,920
Okay. That could be an option too for PMs that are waiting for UX stuff. We're at the same

150
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,840
sprint. And I know that plans done a pretty good job at at least in the past of kind of running ahead

151
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,320
of UX and saying, okay, this is kind of what I think I want this look like before spinning UX

152
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,080
cycles on making a more high-fi mockup. So just that. If you think it does a better job

153
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:39,440
of describing it than the issue itself than use it. I think in some cases, a picture can be worth

154
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
a thousand words. I mean, I don't know how many words you throw at something. It's like,

155
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,680
for example, one of my things that I request or I I reported on for the release, the kickoff meeting

156
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,120
was expanding the epic view in the roadmap. And like those are basically just a bunch of buzzwords

157
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,280
put together that you're like, okay, what does that mean? Expand epic and I'm just, I literally

158
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,120
thought on that one for like 20 minutes saying, how do I make this epic? How do I make this issue

159
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,320
titled like more descriptive for customer value? And it just came down to like, that is the functionality

160
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
we're adding. What does that mean? Oh, here's the screenshot. You can see that we're going to add a

161
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,400
drop down and you can see the issues and the children uppicks that are attached to that epic. And in

162
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,400
that case, like I was like, I'm so thankful I have a screenshot. Even though that one is actually

163
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,440
not a high-fi mockup, it's more as more low-fi, it was a little bit pieced together. So,

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,880
yeah, I think like in general, there's a lot more value if we can show something like that.

165
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,960
So, you know, the product manager, you can you can consider that. You should feel free that you

166
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,000
you're empowered to take a tool that you're comfortable with, even it might even be just like

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
go with slides and make something that gets you at least out part of the way there in terms of what

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
you want to experience to look like. Yep, perfect.

169
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,080
3C, I thought the talk track shifted. I was definitely more a problem focused. I noticed a number

170
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,440
of speakers really trying to zero in on that, which is perfect. Some of them could have been more

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,760
problem focused, I thought. So, just keep considering that as you, as you, it's important to be

172
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,480
able to pitch these things in ways that people that aren't close to it can understand. And so,

173
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
just think about that. How do I explain this as someone who's cold, who doesn't know a darn thing

174
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,920
about this, why should they care? That getting that crystal in your thinking is going to be

175
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,680
important no matter what. So, it's time will spend. Thanks, Scott. This is Green Island. I just said

176
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,080
add to that if you don't mind. I think this has always been a challenge in product, even before I

177
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,960
joined GetLab for many people's how to get there on some of this terminology.

178
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,960
Those of us have deep technical background. So, my thought would be, is there a way that you can

179
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:02,560
start sharing or applauding good examples of this so that the product team can start to kind of

180
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,560
reminate on this and develop that scale if or not there yet? Yeah, I thought Lucas were very well

181
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,680
framed up. Those, those two popped out at me as yeah, that's the problem we're trying to solve.

182
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
Check those out. I'll all look through for some other examples.

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Thank you for the suggestion. All right, 3D, we went long. We just have a ton of speakers,

184
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,720
which I love that lots of people get a chance to speak. So, I'm good with that, but we're going to have

185
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,880
we're going to have to limit the number of items probably. So, it looks like there's some other

186
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,720
ideas in here. Perhaps themes. Yeah, I mean, if there are some that relate to each other,

187
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,560
you could just tell a story. Hey, we're trying to prove this and then A, B, and C, tie back to it.

188
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,120
I think it's okay to be pretty brief in your description as long as you're hitting. What it is

189
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,840
and if somebody is really interested, they can dive deep. The themematic is a good idea.

190
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,840
The courted video, if you really want to go deep, maybe it's technically complex.

191
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
That's a great idea and then you can just cover the customer value to high level,

192
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,240
only the detail to the video. Watch statistics. I think Josh looked this up last time. I think

193
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,200
he said there were a thousand, oh, there we go. Kenny's putting it in. So, somewhere between

194
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:54,400
500 and a thousand. To kind of add to the time, just a feedback, I was timing myself this time.

195
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,680
And I had two features listed and I hit three minutes in 14 seconds. Obviously,

196
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,640
I was short in that. So, when we talk about, you know, I think somebody mentioned doing two or

197
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,640
coupling it down, it's interesting that I landed there with the two that I chose.

198
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah, that feels about average, but we've had how many speakers will probably have to be a

199
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,560
couple minutes max for person? I mean Eric pointed this out in the next line. I do think we

200
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,200
are due for a rethink of how we're doing the kickoff because we're going to have next month,

201
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,960
we're going to have 25 people trying to give content and even at two minutes already gone.

202
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,840
So, yeah, we expanded it. I will give a shout out for Jason, I know, because he's on

203
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,920
paternity leave created a video, but I think the original intent of the kickoff was actually just

204
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,880
as a company we had a retrospective and a kickoff. A retrospective immediately followed by a

205
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,680
kickoff and we just decided to post that on YouTube. I mean, I post a whole bunch of content on

206
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,840
YouTube. So, just having what you would normally do for your kind of like grooming or kickoff

207
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
within your individual group posted to YouTube and us, maybe having a specific channel for people

208
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,880
who wanted to follow it. We should discuss the issue and come up with something I do think prior to

209
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:29,680
next release kickoff. Just to evaluate alternatives to the format? Yeah, I mean, I don't even

210
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,400
if we said every person has one minute. I feel like we're doing a disservice because we're now

211
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,520
highlighting much less because we feel like we have a time constraint and need to keep it into one

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:51,760
synchronous 30 minute block. I need to do that. Okay. Yeah, plus one to the revamping it, I think

213
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,960
I think we're trying to, it's like, it's got so many jobs right now that we're not doing a good job

214
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,600
it any of, if we're one of them. I think that feels the most important customers are internal

215
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
and it's just like when it's getting internalling about because like, the people tend to think that

216
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,520
we had like 50 people on a Zoom call alone not even considering YouTube and people were asking

217
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,840
about what happened to YouTube link and things like that. So it's well attended internally

218
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,320
to think there's sort of alignment. So I'm going to let him know, you know, marketing value of like

219
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,480
that sort of like a release, for fictional customers it kind of feels like that, that are off

220
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:41,440
of them like a webinar or live stream on the release date. Right. Yeah, maybe the externally

221
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,280
focused one would be more about what we just shipped. There was a webinar that used to happen

222
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,760
called release writer. I think I participated in a couple of those three of them back to back

223
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,760
and they were pretty poorly attended from what my experience was and I think they actually got

224
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,600
ended by the product marketing team for that reason. I'm sure someone from that team could actually

225
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,560
give feedback. But I think one thing about the time limit is it's really hard to motivate

226
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,360
problems particularly like in a short amount of time particularly when they're very technical like

227
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
as product categories grow in maturity and sophistication like the problems become more and more

228
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,720
specific that we're solving and so motivating those specific reasons and why we're going up to like

229
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,960
this specific tiny piece of the very mature category. It's hard to do with 30 seconds

230
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,840
in a way then. So if we want to do that better that's going to put more and more pressure on

231
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:53,040
like communicating every reasonable number of items. I think. Okay. Thank you all for the feedback.

232
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:59,600
I like the idea of creating an issue and perhaps tweaking the format before next month. I also like

233
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,680
the idea of asking internal and external constituents with a like or don't like about the format.

234
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeah. I just want to finalize that on that. I love that it's a half an hour. I almost even

235
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,280
like take particular categories over over a link thing the time as an example just because I

236
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,680
feel the feeling that if you want to watch it consistently it's going to be in that block. But that's

237
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,800
like if other customers are saying it would like the larger block then that's the right way to

238
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,480
go. So that's where I love to get feedback and some fashion to say okay you know here's how we

239
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,120
should change it. But we clearly have gone breath wise we've gone so much broader that it's going to

240
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:52,320
be hard to have all the topics in it. Okay. Thanks Kenny for starting the issue.

241
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:01,440
James, over to you for number four. Yeah. I just thought I'd share this for many I think many on this

242
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,480
call haven't heard not conspets speak about product discoveries but he advocated that this

243
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,920
quite a number of times previously from his experience reckoning these that a prior company.

244
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,080
So the idea is kind of different to it. I guess a UX discovery sprint I think Fabian linked one of

245
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,520
the books about that where it's really focused on UX iteration and research the product discovery

246
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,240
sprint is more focused on kind of like actually building something iterating on something that's

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,240
built and trying to get to some sort of NVC really quickly by trying to make the process more synchronous.

248
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,160
So the source code group is going to try and do that around file by file. Different navigation

249
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:54,080
to solve performance and usability problems in 12.3 and I thought it'd be interesting to

250
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,440
share that because internally we've been wrestling with like how to make this work well in an

251
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,080
async slash remote environment. So we're looking at trying to confine the participants in a specific

252
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,400
time zone so that we can all be available with the significant amount of overlap but that's also

253
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,240
difficult because we have it kind of excludes automatically 50% of the team who are just geographically

254
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,160
remote from any of their peers. We only have one UX designer that's only available in the

255
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,760
European times zone. So some interesting challenges there. If it goes well we're going to try and replicate

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,400
it a release or two later on a different problem that is also really complicated and hard and we're

257
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,960
going to make progress on quickly but I'll share any findings we have and if anyone's interested

258
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,840
discussing that we need more and put a meeting my calendar or drop me a set message. This is great

259
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,600
James. By the way I think the UX team is going to run well let me just say we have the option to

260
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,000
run one with Google Ventures who's one of our investors in that sprint book that Fabian Link 2

261
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,280
was written by a guy from GV they did hundreds of these things for our clients they know what they're

262
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,120
doing so if we get a chance to do one with them we should we're going to have to figure out how to

263
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,080
do it within our ASIC model though. So whatever you learn from yours James please feed that back

264
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,480
super interesting topic I think if we could get good at this ASIC honestly that would be a breakthrough.

265
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,720
Yeah I think one other interesting challenges that the sprint sort of terminology is kind of

266
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,440
challenging and like it's not sustainable to be doing design sprints or discovery sprints on a daily basis

267
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,320
whether or not we were in person or not it's not scalable to actually sprint all the time so

268
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,520
choosing the right task choosing the right time is I think one of the other challenges.

269
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,680
I agree yeah you don't want to do this for everything because well if you follow to the letter

270
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,960
it takes a whole week and you're totally dedicated to it which is amazing for focus sake

271
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,280
but you can't get anything else done so depending on how we structure this it would need to be done

272
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:21,280
for things that are really big unknowns where dedicating a huge big chunk of time like that is worth it

273
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,760
and not everything clears that bar. I think it's also most relevant for

274
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
for stages that are very interesting to be doing in the very beginning kind of like

275
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,400
that iron was like one of their biggest example for Google ventures when they always say like

276
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,360
solving clinical trials for the world is like a super complex problem so they just figure out

277
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,360
what is this a standard we can do so that we can start getting there and I think these are the

278
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:57,680
problems that that is a sprint is useful. We used it pretty successfully in my last company around

279
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,800
pricing of packaging stuff and ran a bunch of interviews with customers on that so

280
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:15,840
I've seen it work. All right okay Christopher number five. Yeah just want to

281
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,680
call out we've over the past month we've had a significant number of outages related to dot com

282
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,840
and that affect at least a one customer revenue with actual and because of that you know we've

283
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,200
had some focus from an exact leadership perspective so I encourage everybody to look at that

284
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,880
document and kind of look through it and particularly there's a couple of things from an engineering

285
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,560
perspective make it where one is as we started it infrastructure to development board where we're

286
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,680
going to start matching issues up and trying to make sure that that those get prioritized highly

287
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,520
where appropriate particularly for anything that you know affects performance around these issues

288
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,280
the other issue that I put in there was one around that's listed specifically which is around

289
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:12,080
the fact of prioritizing P performance availability work so one of the significant features of this

290
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,920
up to go recent outage last week was is that the register server apparently can't handle the

291
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,200
load anymore and we started digging into it we found a bunch of stuff that we hadn't checked

292
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,080
it like for instance that is an example rj unit test where basically going and getting cashed

293
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,400
and there was no limit on the number of unit tests that could actually be cash so we were getting these

294
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,240
like blocks of like several megabytes of data that had the basically be transferred around and

295
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,160
read us and that's really what's affecting its performance overall from our cashing service perspective

296
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,920
so consequently it's got I said that to you I hope that's okay. It feels like it was like

297
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,240
you need to help out when it hurts the effect of how do we best make sure that we get this kind of

298
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
systematically going and I just want to make sure that everybody was aware and just kind of

299
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,000
hoping for a discussion with any questions or any feedback or early feedback on it from that

300
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,440
perspective. I added some comments to it Christopher. Okay I haven't had a chance to look

301
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,000
up all just about that problem. Can I ask do we and maybe make this a question for you do we categorize

302
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,400
performance issues as bugs? We do have a performance label but they should be under under bugs.

303
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah this is an example where oftentimes the way we treat performances is a reactionary.

304
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,680
This is trying to think about it more in a proactive way so like as an example I'll give a

305
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,760
horrible example but when I worked at Amazon tags originally when Amazon was created tags were

306
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,120
they were expecting to label certain instances and it turns out that all customer started using

307
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,880
20 and 30 or 50 tags and they realized tags were being used to basically share environmental

308
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,040
information so the VMs could they could put the same drop of code on two different VMs and

309
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,080
they could behave differently based on the tag which was a total novel way for customers to use it

310
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,520
so then they had the basic glue on it that number of tags they could use because it wasn't

311
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,880
scaling with the system effectively. So this is kind of another example where like I think we

312
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,000
got to start thinking in terms of you know like when we create something new a new feature of

313
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
piece of functionality like what's the cost associated with that right because like it does cost

314
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,360
something internal and I'm not asking product managers to necessarily think in terms of the

315
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,840
exact bytes but I am concerned to think in terms of like you know what are the expectations around

316
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,280
it because like as an example if we went back and looked at J unit test or reporting you know if

317
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,320
we said unlimited that's you know that's a tough engineering call right particularly guess it's free right

318
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,280
for customers to do is a minor standing we also don't have a number of reposemirers we don't have a limit on that

319
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,840
and that that seems dangerous yeah so I guess I would comment you know I think the product team

320
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,160
is expected to prioritize all things and to understand them deeply whether they're a security issue or

321
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,440
performance concern I think what you're highlighting is in order to be proactive I don't know if the

322
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,560
product team would immediately know the impact of a proposed change but maybe that's not

323
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:16,880
too many for our infrastructure SRE stable counterparts to be involved in vetting and looking at

324
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,080
issues early in the pipeline to decide whether or not they would yeah or or let's say we're

325
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,000
implementing a feature like let's say we were implementing mirror from scratch like the first

326
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,560
question we should be asking is it's like how many mirrors is a customer expected to be able to support

327
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,480
and what I want to start charging for if they get above the certain limit and you know

328
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,800
and right now we don't and you could argue that scaling is just as much a reason for customers to

329
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,160
start paying us as as feature sets that's that's kind of the argument I would do thank you

330
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,560
because those things cost money like whether we like to admit it or not

331
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
yeah Chris I would have I would agree with you on what you're trying to sort of shape up and call out

332
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,000
here and the sense of you know going through pages for example performance of getting those

333
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,520
pageal is loaded is not great and I don't know if we set out originally to track some of those

334
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,920
performance things but I think that performance and into your point can I think performance

335
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,400
should be somewhere incorporated as we move forward and something we should be thinking about

336
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:32,800
for scalability across the board because it's just as important as bringing forth that really cool

337
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,160
thing to them is that that really cool thing works and people will stay there to use it

338
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,080
I think just as a cycle I think we have something the product and book that I

339
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,240
would like a couple days ago on performance something like fast applications are like always

340
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,760
you know like more usable and I think that's that's definitely important and I also think that

341
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,320
Githleb.com is massive I think we have four million users and for example for GEO I know that

342
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,800
only by actually interacting with the infrastructure we are getting feedback on some of the performance

343
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,520
bottlenecks that we are just not seeing otherwise so I and so I think that's actually also

344
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,680
really valuable and in that regard maybe also again you know dog fooding these things helps and

345
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,920
I think with the combination of CD we may hit a lot of those things that we're doing.

346
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah and the dog fooding thing on that front is a little confusing me I met with

347
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:40,080
Marin to talk about that and you know there's sort of this mentality of looking at dot com first

348
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,680
or leading the dot com for scalability and I just it's not really crisp to me where we're going

349
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,640
from making sure that we're you know how we approach me ensure that we in tech scalability for dot

350
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,600
com if we're starting the dot com or restarting somewhere else from a dot fooding perspective.

351
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm pretty sure the handbook says that we're meant to well at least the guidelines used to be

352
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,520
that for new features they were meant to be available and get lab dot com and sell post at the same

353
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:17,760
time and that there used to be a production rate pretty checklist that I think the engineering team

354
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,520
was responsible for. I know that for when we want to go there was a production readiness process

355
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,840
that we had to go through and certainly we could easily we consider these things on the source

356
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,200
code front where readily considering scale like moving terabytes of data from the database and the

357
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,840
object storage and considering all these sorts of things performance is very much a feature and

358
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,200
should be considered that and I think particularly in categories where adoption is still growing

359
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,640
and early stages of maturity performance like understandably is less of a concern because there's

360
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,680
low usage so like solving scale at like any normal level doesn't make sense commercially

361
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,640
like necessarily when usage is small so there is a bit of a juggling act here because

362
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,480
we don't want to build a product for billions of users if there's only I don't know 20,000 users

363
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,320
experimenting with our newest feature so there's an iterative approach that is to be taken but I

364
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,040
would agree that particularly coming from a team that's digging out a lot of technical debt

365
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,440
and solving a lot of performance problems all the time we probably historically not been very good at

366
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,960
picking the right moment to pay off technical debt and address performance problems until they become

367
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:36,160
fires so yeah so to that point just real quick James and sorry Scott I think some things are

368
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,200
obvious like when we look at our progressive deliveries strategy I think that we like if you

369
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,360
look at something like feature flags or something like that's something that I think is going to be like

370
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,560
I wouldn't imagine that that's not going to be a key feature that we're going to bring forward

371
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,120
so I feel like that should be a give me on whether adoption has yet struck or not

372
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,400
but the second thing that is not clear to me like again when I was interviewing Mary and about dog

373
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,720
fooding is that I noticed that Mary and like we don't this isn't we weren't they didn't come to us first

374
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,080
and so this is not scalable or this is not usable for us internally and so it's like the

375
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,840
approach and process moving forward to dog food in the right spots is not cleared to me or

376
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,480
what the best practice has been or if anybody's you know crack that yeah I can give a concrete

377
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,680
example please I did a call with Mary and a few months back around confidential murder quests

378
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,960
so we knew that customers wanted to resolve them we knew that we wanted to do that and we're trying

379
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,200
to get rid of dev.gilab.org so I had a video call with him and a bunch of acin conversations with like

380
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,280
I've got these ideas for what a first iteration looks like and then we did a few calls and worked

381
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
through them and worked out which were the things that needed to happen and so we're shipping the

382
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,520
first iteration of that and 12.1 but we coordinated with them and spoke I spoke with Mary

383
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,520
and quite a lot to make sure whatever we were building was useful and we'd solved the security

384
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,760
problems that they had as well as our own ones so yeah I agree it needs to be proactive when

385
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,080
often a ship something's useful or that the infrastructure team is going to want to opt into

386
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,360
unless we've had a conversation with them in advance. All right it's I'm 30 seconds I had one

387
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,080
like the last time you point it it's sometimes really important for customers as well that

388
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,880
we're running it on getlab.com before they adopt it so one example is we built SSL TLS support

389
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,320
in getily but it's not turned on in getlab.com and so the customer that we built it for isn't using it

390
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,840
because they're waiting for our production team to turn it on because they want to see before

391
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,080
they turn it on for their enormous instance have we actually proven it at the world's largest

392
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,440
getlab instance scale so I think that's one important reason why we always need to make sure that

393
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,000
features are on and I'm getting used on getlab.com. Just kidding again my rip sorry I got a couple

394
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,520
things I think we'd definitely have a stronger definition I've done as part of our precious delivery

395
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,880
right and so part of something that's done is it needs to run at scale and get lab.com 6.3

396
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,680
and not below the cost model not below performance and if it does it's just going to be rewarded

397
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,520
frankly and that should be the bar for getting features across the line that doesn't mean for new

398
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,080
features that have low usage that obviously they're impacted quite small but they still it needs

399
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,280
to be within reason I totally agree that you don't want to overbuild on the first iteration for

400
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,040
planning for millions of users to have about to make any sense but yeah I think that's one aspect

401
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,000
I think their aspect is that I'm coming across run pricing and we can maybe have a fall up here

402
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,280
on like a havoc update but I think it's interesting that customer is well absorbed the cost

403
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,040
on self-managed of compute and so for them if they want to have a ridiculous number of

404
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,040
you know mirror just then you know and it's fine because they're paying for it so use cases on the

405
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,840
time and so maybe a way of thinking about this is to have some level of controls you can set if you

406
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,000
want to hear the instance of all those sort of I don't have some way to control that

407
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,400
and matter behavior for when we're covering the cost of those things but yeah

408
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:23,040
anyways thank you all great topic Christopher please pile on that issue with thoughts on how to

409
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,000
handle this like you're suggesting on definition of done Josh.

410
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:37,200
All right Karina, six and seven. Yes so I submitted an MR for the product template yesterday

411
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,720
and we're going through this process of getting more self-organized in the release

412
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,440
area and with our engineering and user design partners and one of the things that we

413
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,880
recognize and it's documented in the issue below in number seven is you know one our delivery

414
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,200
percentage is not been great what you heard me talk about but it's been a great ramp that we need

415
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,240
to self-organize around some method and what we found and sort of the last prioritization for

416
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:22,320
a release scope is that we have a lot of oversized issues and features that you know honestly

417
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,240
need a need a beat or release to go through user research maybe look at the code if they've

418
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,120
never seen the code you know reviewed that piece of code before or makes the recommendations on

419
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,760
the best way to solve so I put some thinking around you know that sort of you know that dual

420
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,640
track mindset dual truck agile kind of launching off of what user experiences recently updated

421
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,560
for dual track agile so feedback on that and then the second piece is that this experiment

422
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,200
running is leveraging semi dual track agile approach just to organize our conversation

423
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:09,680
how we open issues for areas that we need a discovery beat versus presenting an issue that is actually

424
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,240
ready for delivery one thing that was interesting Scott we were talking about you know just the

425
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,360
kickoff call and having some you know images and and more to share um that's definitely where I

426
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,000
think we'd like to be with release is getting ahead of that curve and really having

427
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,680
I'm some concrete understanding and prototypes of what we're trying to to present deliver

428
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,360
but when we looked at sort of kind of going through that process you know this is really for complex

429
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:44,640
things or heavy lifting because you know it is about a 20 to 30 day lead time to come in

430
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:53,840
release so just and so we have some targets to improve you know our hypothesis on leveraging this

431
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,840
you get follow it there if you haven't put but um it kind of tied together but I love

432
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,520
and put on the handsbook piece. Thank you Karina for creating these and sharing these I think

433
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,720
you're on the right track in parallel I've been working with like Christopher and Eric and Christy

434
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,160
to outline a high level description of our software development life cycle which will have two tracks

435
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,120
this is sort of competing content there or maybe or maybe they could be merged so thank you for

436
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,560
doing this I may slow roll it a little bit to make sure that we have one way of describing

437
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,680
the flow we'd like to go through but thank you very much for getting it kicked off.

438
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:47,760
Any questions for Karina? If not Joshua what are you?

439
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,600
Yeah just a few of the basic announcements you're showing through a ring the promise

440
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,880
